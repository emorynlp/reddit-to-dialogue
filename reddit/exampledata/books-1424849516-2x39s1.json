  "text": "[A package in the mail!](http://imgur.com/a/kZQHk) \n\nWe had several very sweet redditors offer to send Travis some Calvin and Hobbes books-- I was astounded at how many lovely people wanted to give him something. /u/SamF7 wrote and asked if they could send him the entire collection, but went even further and sent him a stuffed Hobbes, too! Travis was over-the-moon happy to open his package from Amazon. \n\nThank you so much, SamF7 (and all the other kind-hearted redditors who wanted to do something nice for my kiddo!) You are totally amazing. : )\n\n**Holy cow!** What a nice surprise to wake up to! This is like double excellent day!! /u/SamF7, ARE YOU SEEING THIS? About a billion people think you are pretty damn awesome!! : )\n\n**Just told Travis that over 3,000 people all over the world saw this and thought it was cool: his eyes got huge! He is enjoying the fame!**",

If it were only one person, it wouldn't be inspiring.  It would be depressing.  It's the fact that this sort of kindness is actually fairly common that makes it uplifting.\n\nBut we should still show appreciation from time to time for these common things, so people will not get beaten down and stop doing them.

He pissed off his publishers and endured a lot of stress and conflict, in order to *turn down* the opportunity to earn millions of dollars for no effort. Sure he's a curmudgeon, but it's exactly that curmudgeonly worldview which creates a lot of the joy and humour in C&H. I'd admire Watterson a lot less if he'd been writing strips [like this](http://marcel-oehler.marcellosendos.ch/comics/ch/1992/08/19920827.gif) while raking it in from merchandising deals.\n\nAnd because his publishers (to their credit) eventually acceded to his wishes, there never was any authorized C&H tie-in merchandise ([Except the books, two calendars, and *one* T-shirt.](https://mrod.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/the-complete-calvin-and-hobbes-free-and-online/)). Which means that Travis' toy is probably an illegal knock-off, but I don't think that's going to bother Travis much. (The other, awesomer possibility is that the toy is non-commercially hand-made by the person who sent it or a friend of theirs. Maybe we can just choose to go with that narrative.)",

I was sort of keeping it in pristine condition thinking that it was a collectors item (right -- mass produced and sold at Costco, I know).\n\nAnyway, my kids have now been reading the books for a few years, and they are in pretty bad shape.  But I love that they just leave them out on the breakfast table and flip through them and start to laugh out loud every morning.  It's something pretty amazing to see how well this comic strip has held up over the years.  \n\nBooks are meant to be read and shared and I hope your kids get as much pleasure out of them as mine have.",

My original post mentioned he might be on the autistic spectrum (and after reading a huge thick book about it, I'm almost positive he has Aspergers), so I know a lot of the dyslexia and dysgraphia go hand in hand with that. He's getting a full-on evaluation in a few weeks, so we'll know more then. Thank you for the tip, and the very sweet offer!!! : )",

That's a ridiculous notion. It would be like supplementing your friends going out to eat instead of giving to a place that feeds the hungry (something I do, I don't know why everyone pulls out Africa, there are people hungry in your community who need help. If you live in Philly, I can recommend a great charity). \n\n",
