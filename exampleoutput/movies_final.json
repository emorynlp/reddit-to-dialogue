    "title:": "Robert Pattinson doesn't need to be \"forgiven\" for his work in the Twilight franchise & \"Batman\" Or \"Good Time\" is not his redemption. He was brilliant in Twilight, this is about Male Vs Female Gaze.",
    "text": " Note : Ignore my English not being perfect, I'm not a native speaker. So Robert Pattinson is receiving a lot of praise for his work in the latest Batman movie & deservedly so. I was ecstatic when they announced it. Like many, I have been following his work since Harry Potter & the Goblet of fire. He was good then, he is good now. Playing a convincing Vampire on screen & doing justice to a character from a successful book franchise is no easy feat & he did it in his early 20s & was absolutely brilliant in it. No one else could've played Edward Cullen as well as he did it. . It's a given that whatever women like is dissed in this patriarchal society. So whatever women like is looked down upon. Be it rom coms, boy bands, the color pink. Whatever is pre-dominantly liked by men is seen as having superior taste. Robert Pattinson should not be ashamed of his work in the Twilight franchise because that is what put him on the world map & brought him to the attention of movie watchers all over. Also he played his role perfectly well & did justice to it. He deserves the same amount of praise for Twilight series, Water for Elephants, Lighthouse, Good time, Batman. He didn't become good overnight because he starred in a movie that the male audience approves of. Women's taste is valid too. So many reviewers like Chris Stuckman have been saying that he can be \"forgiven\" for his twilight years. No Chris, he doesn't need to be forgiven. Women have been campaigning for him as a good actor way before you watched \"Good time\" Or \"Light house\".",

I thought the first episode was really interesting but then it got really soap opera-ish and dragged on. About to finish up with Election Year and Forever.

I don't know why most of Die Hard fans don't like the fourth movie but for me it pretty good sequel. I love to watch Die Hard 4. The story is too far from the original film but still worked for the plot of Die Hard film. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Justin Long is better than Bruce Willis and Jai Courtney in Die Hard 5. The helicopter/ car chase scene in Die Hard 4 is so intense and the scene when McClane drive a car to take down the villain helicopter is so damn cool to me. I like the concept of the fourth movie with the analog hero against the cyber terrorists. McClane is a old cop but still kick ass. He don't understand any IT stuff but in this movie he must deal with this. The main villain in Die Hard 4 is not memorable like the villain in the first one film but still okay for me. His character is so simple but not the worst it way better than the villain in Die Hard 5. The favourite action scene in Die Hard 4 for me is the scene McClane VS. Maggie Q's character that so badass scene.",

You’re going to travel hundreds of thousands of years into the future and halfway across the universe to have desert tribesmen speaking like valley girls? Also, no voiceover at the beginning explaining everything. It’s like De Villeneuve was not confident enough in his production to let the images and actors speak for themselves, so he had an \"Idiot's Guide to Dune\" (written by idiots as well, just so the other idiots can understand what the idiots who wrote the guide were trying tell them) read over the opening scenes by a 14-year-old valley girl. She says, “why did the emperor choose this path, and who will our next oppressors be?” Why do I have to have you tell me what questions to ask? David Lynch never subjected me to this kind of micromanagement. I’m guessing De Villeneuve is a micromanager. That was it. I could not watch another second of this dreck.

I miss him playing hard and distinct acting roles. Although I’ve disliked most of his latest films, his acting is still great, but the character role is usually very limited or bland.

Now, I don't intend to sound misogynistic or anything like that, but he actually has that effeminate aura around him that just makes it incredibly diffcult to identify with him.

    "text": " So I just rewatched the movie and really enjoyed it, against popular opinion if you believe the abysmal ratings. But please let me elaborate why: Although the movie certainly has its weak spots in its presentation of martial arts and fans of the series hate that Ralph Macchio plays no role in Part 4, its feministic approach and the main characters emotional development to overcome grief are its true stenhs. The plot, even though a bit exaggerated in some aspects, is also quite plausible and on the same level as the first movie. A short summary: After an honoration ceremony for his companys achievements in WWII, Mr. Miyagi meets his late comrades widow and offers her to look after her anger riddled grand daughter who lost her parents in a boat accident. Julie at first refuses to listen to the old man but soon becomes interested in his karate lessons to face her bully Ned. After things escalate at school and Julies temporarily suspended the unusual pair takes vacation at a monastery where the young girl not only learns to respect her peers, but also how to defend herself. After they return home Julie and her love interest Eric enjoy their date on Prom night until the bullies crash the party and Ned challenges Eric to a fight. The couple avoids confrontation, but is soon engaged by Ned who severly damages Erics car and incites him to fight him at the docks. Julie and Mr. Miyagi soon arrive at the docks to aid the exhausted Eric whos beaten by the bullies under the command of colonel Paul Daugan and defeat the bullies. So what exactly makes this a good flick? The main reason I enjoyed this movie so much is how relatable Julies emotions progress. My favorite qoute that hit home the hardest is \"I've tried some times just to talk to you and not get angry but everything gets messed up and I don't know why\". Might just be me, but I can relate on a personal level with Julies feelings and the lack of control over them at the beginning of the movie. We follow her on her journey from a rebelous, emotionally unstable teenager whos victim of intrusive advances (mind you, this movie came out in the 90s!) to a calm and autonomous personality achieved by the loving support and compassion of Mr. Miyagi. All in all the pIot tackles abuse and vulnerability in a patriarchal society (an issue still to this day) and sports that gender norms can be overcome, shown by Julies ability to stand her ground and defeat her mocking adversary all on her own in the finale. A positive message that was ahead of its time and could be considered progressive even by todays standards.",

I love Michael Ironside but his level of screen villainy was way out of place for a teen drama and a little over-the-top, what with him ordering his students to commit murder because one kid didn't fear him, that said, it was nice to see Pat Morita kick his butt.",

      "While this isn't the best in the franchise it's clear that even this early on Hillary Swank was a much better actor than Ralph Macchio would ever be and she and Pat Morita worked really well together, with her leaning to waltz from Mr. Miyagi being a particularly sweet moment, but where the film stumbles is the rather bizarre conflict this entry tried to manufacture as no longer is there a simple problem with school bullies, instead, we have high school sexual predators to worry about - with Julie being a girl I guess they thought this was the female equivalent of bullying - yet that wasn't apparently enough as we also get Michael Ironside as the bizarre leader of a what appears to be a high school ROTC but who acts as if he's training the Hitler Youth. I love Michael Ironside but his level of screen villainy was way out of place for a teen drama and a little over-the-top, what with him ordering his students to commit murder because one kid didn't fear him, that said, it was nice to see Pat Morita kick his butt.",
      "Julie at first refuses to listen to the old man but soon becomes interested in his karate lessons to face her bully Ned.",
      "Your short summary of the film makes it sound a lot better than it actually is because you left out all of the overly ridiculous parts in the movie.",
      "Tried my best to sum it up as short as possible. After things escalate at school and Julies temporarily suspended the unusual pair takes vacation at a monastery where the young girl not only learns to respect her peers, but also how to defend herself.",
      "This is why I think it is so ripe for redemption if Cobra Kai were to revisit Julie. Rehash the story, make innocent jokes about a few of the problems and prop up the important stuff with more context so it makes more sense.",
      "It lacks credibility in my opinion. After they return home Julie and her love interest Eric enjoy their date on Prom night until the bullies crash the party and Ned challenges Eric to a fight.",
      "My favorite qoute that hit home the hardest is \"I've tried some times just to talk to you and not get angry but everything gets messed up and I don't know why\". The underlying idea of the plot may have been fine. But the execution of actually turning it into a movie was abysmal.",
      "I'm genuinely curious what people dislike about it. The couple avoids confrontation, but is soon engaged by Ned who severly damages Erics car and incites him to fight him at the docks.. Julie and Mr. Miyagi soon arrive at the docks to aid the exhausted Eric whos beaten by the bullies under the command of colonel Paul Daugan and defeat the bullies.",
      "but they showed this one all the time.",
      "So what exactly makes this a good flick?. The main reason I enjoyed this movie so much is how relatable Julies emotions progress.",
      "I think another issue was the male audience's sexism.",
      "My favorite qoute that hit home the hardest is \"I've tried some times just to talk to you and not get angry but everything gets messed up and I don't know why\".. Might just be me, but I can relate on a personal level with Julies feelings and the lack of control over them at the beginning of the movie.. We follow her on her journey from a rebelous, emotionally unstable teenager whos victim of intrusive advances (mind you, this movie came out in the !) to a calm and autonomous personality achieved by the loving support and compassion of Mr. Miyagi.. All in all the pIot tackles abuse and vulnerability in a patriarchal society (an issue still to this day) and sports that gender norms can be overcome, shown by Julies ability to stand her ground and defeat her mocking adversary all on her own in the finale.",
      "This movie used to be on ALL THE TIME when I was a kid, on the disney channel. I remember it but only through the lens of a kid, I have no idea if it would hold up now. I thought it was badass as a kid lol."

I was wondering if I was the only person who does this. So here’s my list 1. Fight choreography 2. Bad lines When they have an actor actress saying a really cheesy or bad line. 3 bad written characters voices ie Having the characters either kissing or sex scene Where it doesn’t belong meaning they’re being chased by a maniac and they decide to stop to have sex or kiss or tell each other how much they love each other the drive me crazy. When a movie has added The political agenda to the movie for example keeping politics out of the movies because it’s just entertainment so they don’t have to have everything to make everybody happy it’s a movie. And having to unbelievable of a scene meaning little things like never reloading the clip of the gun when they’re shooting how they’re holding a gun I need to look realistic when things in my opinion don’t work for realistic in the movie kind of turns me off to it. We’re having someone who’s really small pick up someone is really big with no problem at all so certain things like that. Unless the movie is in the fantasy category",

I find it sad it's kind of underappreciated/not well-known. Now, I haven't seen THAT many films in my life (of which I am ashamed, and I am trying to correct that), but I would say it's easily one of the greatest films ever made. It may seem like an exaggeration, but it's truly a fantastic film. It's aged pretty well for a 65 year old picture, though you may disagree, since the audio can be pretty bad at times, or because of the way the characters talk (which is not like modern films) or because each scene has a kind of deterioriation where opening and closing frames have incorrect/faded colours, before returning to normal. Despite all that, I was really impressed by the film. Do you disagree? Are there any films whatsoever that are similar to this one? I know of Apocalypse Now, which has a similar theme of the jungle being a danger (though not much else in common). Are there any other films I may like if I liked the Bridge on the River Kwai? What would you recommend to sate my need for movies like that one? Any recommendations? I really liked this film, and I refuse to believe there are no similar films.",

      "It's aged pretty well for a 65 year old picture, though you may disagree, since the audio can be pretty bad at times, or because of the way the characters talk (which is not like modern films) or because each scene has a kind of deterioriation where opening and closing frames have incorrect/faded colours, before returning to normal.",

      "The Great Escape and A Bridge Too Far are pretty good.",

The Shining is my favorite book that Stephen King has written, and I personally think the story is the best think King has written…..ever. I’ve read so much about how King has said that the book is basically an autobiography and how personal it is to him. You can feel this with every page you read. The movie is amazing. I know that the movie differs quite a bit from the book, but that doesn’t make it any less great. The acting by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd is some of the best acting that has ever been performed on screen. The tension and slow burn that Stanley Kubrick creates throughout the beginning and middle of the movie is terrifying, and it all leads into the third act where it’s all out nuts! There are so many memorable scenes and lines throughout this movie, and it’s a movie that sticks with you forever. I’m not a fan of a lot of Kubrick movies, but The Shining is one of his that I would put up against any movie for one of the best ever made. Jack Nicholson is so awesome in this movie, and he played the struggling alcoholic father to perfection. I was always shocked that he didn’t get nominated for an Oscar for his acting in this movie.

Unfortunately they decided to make a sequel decades later(Doctor Sleep) and it felt like the complete opposite of the tension, dread and cinematography of the original.",
      "The Shining is my favorite book that Stephen King has written, and I personally think the story is the best think King has written…..ever.",
      "The Shining is one of my absolute favorite movies. I find something new every time I watch it. i love how Kubrick took a story that was about paranormal horror and made it about psychological horror.",
      "Absolutely! I’ve read so much about how King has said that the book is basically an autobiography and how personal it is to him.",
      "The Shining is an absolute perfect film, and of the thousands of movies I've seen only a few.",
      "You can feel this with every page you read.",
      "The Shining is an absolute perfect film, and of the thousands of movies I've seen only a few I'd put in that category(Kubrick's other masterpiece 2001 comes to mind).",
      "The movie is amazing.",
      "The Shining and The Witch are my comfort horror movies. I fall asleep to them quite often.",
      "I know that the movie differs quite a bit from the book, but that doesn’t make it any less great.",
      "A year or so later I met Stephen King at the opening of “Creepshow.” I asked him to sign my copy of the Shining and asked him what he thought of the film. He made a face and said he didn’t care for it.",
      "Big deal. The acting by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd is some of the best acting that has ever been performed on screen.",
      "Still to this day have not met anyone who doesn’t love The Shining!",
      "There’s plenty of people who think it’s terrible. The tension and slow burn that Stanley Kubrick creates throughout the beginning and middle of the movie is terrifying, and it all leads into the third act where it’s all out nuts!",
      "Maybe this shouldn't be as big of a deal to me as it is, but something that impresses me about The Shining is how real and lived-in the sets look. It becomes a lot more appreciable when you watch Doctor Sleep and everything in the same settings looks so phony and stylized.",
      "There are so many memorable scenes and lines throughout this movie, and it’s a movie that sticks with you forever.. I’m not a fan of a lot of Kubrick movies, but The Shining is one of his that I would put up against any movie for one of the best ever made.",
      "If you like film analysis check out collative learning or Rob Adger on YouTube. He has many great analysis videos especially on the Shining and other Kubrick movies.",
      "Jack Nicholson is so awesome in this movie, and he played the struggling alcoholic father to perfection.",
      "Yeah, I'm a fan of it. It's one of the most ominous horror films I can think of. It isn't all that violent by horror standards, but there's an eeriness to it which I don't think is matched by another movie.",
      "Very eerie!"

If you haven’t seen the first film, First Blood, it’s a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn’t a psychotic nationalist, he’s a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He’s a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It’s not even an action film, it’s a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn’t Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were. Then, in the second film, we get a neck shattering 180 into full on Ronald Reagan revisionism of the war in Vietnam. Rambo 2 perpetuates several popular and resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war and that the war would have been won by Americans of only we (the American people) had allowed them to win. To say Rambo 2 is cultural vandalism would be putting it mildly. It’s a cinematic tragedy. They took a poignant anti war film and made it into a jingoistic Cold War fantasy.",

    "text": " I was just rewatching the 2014 Godzilla and it had me thinking how so many fans and critics didn't really like the movie. Personally I think the movie is really underrated compared to the newer ones. And I wasn't to go over certain elements which make this movie extremely good if your willing to really sit down and I've it a try. First is the score of it was fantastic I feel like every soundtrack fit and had this looming darkness and epic scale to it. I loved how it almost reminded me of the original theme and I think they matched each scene the a solid track nothing felt out of place. It also felt almost retro monster but modern thriller, hard for me to explain but I highly recommend anyone to go back and listen. Now the plot is slow I can definitely agree with that and I can see why people might say it's boring. The beginning does not have much action but it doesn't need it. Now every single movie feels like a blockbuster action flick and it all feels the same. I think what the movie did different and feels amazing combined with the score is the build up. This unknown force, that feeling in the back of you head that there's something wrong, almost like there's a big shadow looking over. This might come as a sin but I think they did a better build up then jaws which alot of people seem to compare. Now the characters are a mix feeling for me I think Brian Cranston did an outstanding job, like Oscar worthy, you feel his pain, his raw emotion, and the fear. Watching his scenes is the biggest treat ever and I think they did mess up by killing his character. Which people say movie drops off, and I kinda agree going from his amazing performance to the other actor Aaron Johnson who plays his son feels like a downgrade. While we still have both of them together the scenes are great you can really feel that they dealt with the grief of the mother/wife they own way. The second half of the movie with the weaker characters still remains strong to the films greatest strenhs which are the tone, cinematography, and again build up. We are watching and waiting in dread as we see glimpses of these forces of nature be revealed and eventually clash. I think the average Godzilla fans will appreciate all the history and Easter eggs that the movie includes and the call backs. And movie fans should really like great film making. I wrote this sitting down after finishing the movie, my thoughts are pretty scattered and I didn't really put alot of effort into this so please don't go to hard on me about spelling and layout lol. Let me know what you think and I highly recommend anyone to give it a try again in 2022 I think they will be pleasantly surprised",

      "I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan and I have loved Godzilla 2014 since it came out. I saw it 3 times in the theater and several times since. I enjoy the slower pacing because honestly I like all of the characters and cared what happened to them.",
      "I normally don’t like the human plot lines because they feel redundant or cheesy compared to global destruction and the mythos/lore of the monsters. I liked Godzilla 2014 because it had good human actors in a suspenseful story tied to the monsters.",
      "Godzilla 2014 is to Godzilla KOM like The Batman is to Batman v Superman. The former(s) being subdued, dark, character pieces that are more story driven and the latter(s) are just carnival slop for people who laugh when people jingle keys in front of their faces. Godzilla 2014 was always good, I think people just really hated that Cranston wasn't a bigger piece.",
      "The human characters were some of the worst I've seen in any movie. 2014 could've been better than I was but it was still a pretty great Godzilla movie. A bit more screen time for Godzilla and keeping Bryan Cranston instead of Aaron Taylor Johnson and it could've been perfect.",
      "I need to rewatch Godzilla '14, but when I saw it a few years ago I remember not liking it much because it was slow, the characters weren't interesting, and Godzilla itself isn't seen much at all for most of the movie. I know that a lot has been made of the underuse of Bryan Cranston, but from a plot and character point of view, his arc was done; he wanted to find out about his wife, and he did. His death was meant to motivate Aaron Taylor-Johnson to move forward and so carry the story.",
      "This may be a controversial or unpopular opinion, but I think that Godzilla '98 is actually a better movie than Godzilla '14, because its pacing is faster, its human characters are more interesting, and Godzilla is seen more often throughout the movie.",
      "I really liked it when it came out, I never really understood the complaints about \"not enough Godzilla\" because to me so much of the appeal of monster movies is the build-up of anticipation. They also capture the scale of Godzilla better than any monster movie I've seen.",

      "Godzilla 2014, Second chance. I was just rewatching the 2014 Godzilla and it had me thinking how so many fans and critics didn't really like the movie.",
      "I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan and I have loved Godzilla 2014 since it came out. I saw it 3 times in the theater and several times since. I enjoy the slower pacing because honestly I like all of the characters and cared what happened to them.",
      "How'd you like Shin? Personally I think the movie is really underrated compared to the newer ones.",
      "I normally don’t like the human plot lines because they feel redundant or cheesy compared to global destruction and the mythos/lore of the monsters. I liked Godzilla 2014 because it had good human actors in a suspenseful story tied to the monsters.",
      "Yup, 100 agree. And I wasn't to go over certain elements which make this movie extremely good if your willing to really sit down",
      "Godzilla 2014 is to Godzilla KOM like The Batman is to Batman v Superman. The former(s) being subdued, dark, character pieces that are more story driven and the latter(s) are just carnival slop for people who laugh when people jingle keys in front of their faces. Godzilla 2014 was always good, I think people just really hated that Cranston wasn't a bigger piece.",
      "True. and I've it a try.",
      "The human characters were some of the worst I've seen in any movie. 2014 could've been better than I was but it was still a pretty great Godzilla movie. A bit more screen time for Godzilla and keeping Bryan Cranston instead of Aaron Taylor Johnson and it could've been perfect.",
      "I 100% agree. First is the score of it was fantastic I feel like every soundtrack fit and had this looming darkness and epic scale to it.",
      "I need to rewatch Godzilla '14, but when I saw it a few years ago I remember not liking it much because it was slow, the characters weren't interesting, and Godzilla itself isn't seen much at all for most of the movie. I know that a lot has been made of the underuse of Bryan Cranston, but from a plot and character point of view, his arc was done; he wanted to find out about his wife, and he did. His death was meant to motivate Aaron Taylor-Johnson to move forward and so carry the story.",
      "I loved how it almost reminded me of the original theme and I think they matched each scene the a solid track nothing felt out of place.",
      "This may be a controversial or unpopular opinion, but I think that Godzilla '98 is actually a better movie than Godzilla '14, because its pacing is faster, its human characters are more interesting, and Godzilla is seen more often throughout the movie.",
      "It also felt almost retro monster but modern thriller, hard for me to explain but I highly recommend anyone to go back and listen.",
      "I really liked it when it came out, I never really understood the complaints about \"not enough Godzilla\" because to me so much of the appeal of monster movies is the build-up of anticipation. They also capture the scale of Godzilla better than any monster movie I've seen.",
      "Yup exactly. Now the plot is slow I can definitely agree with that and I can see why people might say it's boring.",
      "Yeah 2014 is head and shoulders above King of the Monsters or Kong vs Godzilla. Those movies are pretty garbage, especially Kong vs Godzilla. The whole weird hollow earth bullshit and strange futurism was such a drastic departure from 2014 which was fairly grounded for a movie featuring Godzilla.",
      "The beginning does not have much action but it doesn't need it.",
      "Watch Shin Godzilla for a contemporary Godzilla one-off. Fucking amazing.",
      "Now every single movie feels like a blockbuster action flick and it all feels the same.",
      "This is a mischaracterization, Godzilla '14 was liked. It might not have been loved, but in general it has a positive view. Just looking at Metacritic, has 26 positive reviews, 21 mixed, and only 1 negative."

    "text": " Terminator 2: Judgement Day The first is a classic, no denying that. But the 2nd is just the near perfect movie to me. The story is incredible as is the execution. It doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence or language, treating it as though it's happening in real life. The score is gorgeous as are the practical FX and the CGI they had at the time (it's still better than some used today, which is shocking because it's a 31 year old movie). You don't have to watch the first to understand the 2nd one, which was how I was introduced to the Terminator movies, through the 2nd one before streaming was a thing. The detail in storytelling is amazing, the stakes are high no matter hoe many times you watch it. The first 5 minutes explains just how serious of a story it is and how fucked up a future they could possibly have if the end of the world did come to their reality the way it happens in the future before the Terminator travels back in time. The character development is remarkable and the characters themselves are played to perfection by their actors. And it has one of the most perfect endings in any movie ever. The bad guy loses, but the price for the bad guy losing comes at a heartbreaking price so even though the protagonist wins in the end, he still loses something and that's what's so powerful. Just because you win, doesn't mean the outcome is a happy one. There's more but this is the gist of how I feel about T2. Now it's your turn, what is your favorite movie and why? I'd like to know.",

But the real reason it is my favorite is because it was the movie that showed me that movies can be more than just simple entertainment.",

      "I love everything about Noir, and sure, there are better made classics but the hyper stylized movie from one of my all time favorite directors that takes all the tropes of the genre and turns them up to 11 was practically tailor made for me. It dethroned Dick Tracy which is still like for a lot of the same reasons. But Robert Rodriguez clinches it over Warren Beatty if I had to pick just one.",

    "text": " Hello. I have low functioning autistim and I like patterns. I am in my late 30s with over 10 years experience studying film. To be clear, a metaphor is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn’t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison. Here are the basics: - A metaphor states that one thing is another thing. - It equates those two things not because they actually are the same, but for the sake of comparison or symbolism. - If you take a metaphor literally, it will probably sound very strange (are there actually any sheep, black or otherwise, in your family?) I recently saw Turning Red and the film director clearly indicated that this is a metaphor for puberty. Menstruation, mood swings, hormones etc. However in the climax I feel it's fair they sort of played it fast and loose with the metaphor. The sailor moon transformation implies that they carry their puberty in a locket and together they used their puberty to drag her mother's puberty into a circle so they can choose to continue repressing their puberty? Uh.. probably just a giant monster fun for all the family! Fair enough. It got me thinking of other movies that clearly explore a visual metaphors that also play it fast and loose. Do you know of any? Sequels, Ed Wood and several student films I've seen come to mind but I'm curious specifically of films that are popular and high budget. But I'm open to whatever comes to mind too. Books, tv, independent, whatever. Please note that I don't want to argue about Turning Red specifically. I doubt I will ever understand what they expected me to think about every interaction the pandas have and that's fine. I'm pretty sure it's fair to say that mostly it's a metaphor for puberty and sometimes it's a fun cute panda and other a plot device so the movie can happen. It's similar to her other short film Bao so this director clearly has a style and that's fine. I am only reaching out because I have a mental disorder that makes memory difficult so if possible I prefer to just hear about other movies that approach metaphors in a similar way.

Of course, an 'era' always has its 'it' crowd and in demand performers, but it seems like the same handful of actors are just everywhere now, across all genres. It is nothing against these actors either, but I definitely start to feel an aversion when they are in too many things again and again. Maybe it is also putting a dampener on movies too, as unless an actor has incredible range and variety of performance, we are losing some range and variety of performance by the same people being in so many movies. Has the movie world always been like this? Am I just noticing it more now? Is it that we are consuming so much more media than ever before that these actors feel like they are in your face more often? Is it the franchise IP that put recurring characters in too many things? Is it traditional studio production and streaming service now side by side mean there is just more content offered to actors? So what do you think? Are there really too few actors in too many things? Are you happy to see them in so many things? Or do you think it is eventually going to work for the detriment of movies. Does Hollywood need to take a step back and slow down, or is the more content, the better?",

      "So it’s always gonna be like that I guess. It is nothing against these actors either, but I definitely start to feel an aversion when they are in too many things again and again.. Maybe it is also putting a dampener on movies too, as unless an actor has incredible range and variety of performance, we are losing some range and variety of performance by the same people being in so many movies.",

      "Is it that we are consuming so much more media than ever before that these actors feel like they are in your face more often?",
      "It's always been like that, however many popular actors of the past had incredible range and talent so it was far more tolerable because they brought something different to every role they played. The acting wasn't one dimensional. Unfortunately, the new batch of actors (outside of a small handful) do not possess nearly as much talent or range as their predecessors so it makes it more obvious when you keep seeing the same face in different roles with less dynamics in their performances.",
      "Is it the franchise IP that put recurring characters in too many things?",
      "But if the Rock, Ryan Reynolds, and Chris Pratt never acted again... I wouldn’t mind.",
      "Is it traditional studio production and streaming service now side by side mean there is just more content offered to actors?",
      "Chris Pratt continues to be a thing (he's got at least two movies coming out soon). Same with Chris Evans.",
      "So what do you think?",
      "Vin Diesel, Bruce Willis, Jason Statham, Nicolas Cage, the rock. I'll be completely turned off from a movie if 1 of them is in it.",
      "Are there really too few actors in too many things?",
      "Same with Chris Hemsworth (Chris Pine has a new movie coming out, don't forget the fourth Chris) The Rock can't disappear fast enough for my liking but we're stuck with him for god knows how long."

I watched Alien 3 before the first two (back in the early 90s before Alien was such an archetype in our media), and I found it way less impactful simply because the Alien was not as scary. I think a gripe that many miss with that film is that it relies on shorthand experience from the previous two films to actually make the Alien scary. If you didn't see everything that the Alien was capable of, they didn't show you a reason to be scared, and you were just kind of like \"okay, this dog thing must be deadly, oh look, it is killing a dude I think.\" Separately, I also saw Terminator 2 before Terminator, and Cameron did a great job making it a self-contained film. The T1000 is an eerie/creepy villain without seeing the first film. Finally, I also saw Predator 2 before Predator 1, and I actually think the experience was better because the Predator is scary as fuck and seems more unstoppable without seeing how Arnie took it down in Predator 1, Predator 1 is a way better movie, but it is almost a scarier series if you watch the second one first.",

    "text": " My SO loves watching movies and TV series, while I more enjoy video games and YouTube. I would say that I prefer video games over movies and TV for the interactivity I have with my entertainment, but that doesn't explain how I can just lose time binging YouTube videos. I find that when I try to sit and watch NetFlix or whatever else at home with my SO, I get really antsy feel like I have to do something, so I start cleaning, going on my computer/phone, getting up to get water excessively to be out of the room, etc. If it's something that catches my attention I'd listen to it while doing something else, but my SO wouldn't want to force me to watch something I don't want to, so I often just end up back on my computer doing something else. I don't like the idea of going to movie theaters because it's a large time commitment for one piece of entertainment and I feel like I would be essentially stuck for a long period of time. That being said, my experiences at the theater tend to be pretty positive once I'm (forced to be) there. I'm not going to be a jerk who goes on their phone at a movie theater. My SO likes talking about movies afterwards, whereas I typically take the film for what it was and leave it at that. This kind of thing has been going on for years, and my SO feels lonely in her enjoyment of shows. We can watch YouTube together, but of course that's not the same, and there's only so much we can show each other before we've ran out. Maybe I can stand YouTube because of differences in content, maybe being able to be in more control of what/how we watch, and videos feeling like shorter, less committal programs even though some YouTube videos can obviously be very long. I understand this is entirely selfish, but if I suggest a show or movie - which mostly are things that are decades old from my childhood - I'm able to stand sitting in one place and paying attention for the most part. Maybe because I know what's going to happen already? I know this is an asshole thing to do, so I've pretty never suggested anything. Most recent example was my SO wanting to watch something at home after hearing good things about it. I found the main character very forward in the beginning, which is a little uncomfortable and unrelatable to me but fine I guess, but in those super awkward social situations that they always seem to add in movies where things are super embarrassing for the characters, I find I can't stand it, and before like 10 minutes into the movie, I instinctively jumped on my phone on Reddit, where I stayed for most of the remainder of the movie, listening to keep along and occasionally glancing. I ended the movie knowing everything that happens, but I wouldn't say I watched and engaged myself in it like my SO did. I understand I'm the odd one out in my friend group when it comes to watching movies, so if I said that I wanted to put more effort to be someone who also enjoys committing the time and attention to immerse myself watching something, at least for the sake of being better company for my SO, what would you suggest I do? Obviously I could just toss my phone, but that doesn't change the overwhelming feeling that I often want to be actively doing something.",

    "text": " I'm pretty mixed on this movie, I think the world building is amazing. They did a phenomenal job setting this world up and making it believable enough. Where this movie fails is in almost every other department. We have 2 of the most boring and bland characters I've ever seen lead a franchise. Yes even more bland and boring than Bella and Edward. And like Bella and Edward they try to make this BS love story so important to everybody and the plot and it just ruins what could be a great story. So halfway thru the movie Rue(who's had about 3 minutes of screen time) dies, I think the singing and fading to white is a cool concept but the actress is just 😐 \"sing for me.\" She doesn't look scared or like she's in pain she just looks bored. They try to make us care about her but she's only had 2 scenes. So a riot starts in her district and it's an interesting dilemma but we only get about 30 seconds of it. We see fighting, arsony, looting, then they're hosed down all in about 30 seconds. And it's never addressed again, we never see those people again or even know any of their names. We get 1 scene of Haymitch telling Crane that to stop the riots they need to have Peeta and Katniss fall in love. I'm sorry what? They just showed us them stopping the riots but are now saying they'll only stop if we give them a love story? Why would they care if Katniss and Peeta bang? I get why the people in the capital would care but would the people in district 11 really care? And why would Crane even listen to Haymitch? Isn't he just a drunk who won a game 1 time? What authority does he have here? The games don't actually start until about an hour in and even with this slow pace we don't really get to know any characters other than Katniss and Peeta. President Snow gets some development but every scene he's in is used strictly for exposition dumps. All he does is monologue what's going on and why. I don't think Donald Sutherland is a good cast as Snow he isn't intimidating or menacing in the slightest. Imagine if Charles Dance was Snow. Now that's a man who commands respect, intimidation, and fear in his rivals. We also don't spend much time with any of the other competitors. Thresh has one 20 second scene and then gets killed by Cato off screen. You have your strongest fighter challenging your best fighter and you don't even show that? Well that sucks. Where the movie also fails is in it's action scenes. I swear the camera man must have been going into cardiac arrest when he was filming this because the shaky cam is insane. I can't make out anything that's going on whenever 2 competitors face off. The only character with any depth ironically is Cato. His posse tho feels like they're ripped straight out of the CW, they are so corny. But Cato in the end I actually felt for him. But then that's ruined by CGI dogs and pitch blackness. Final thoughts I think this world has so much potential but it's ruined by it's characters and their stories. Does anybody really care about Katniss and Peeta's love story? No. 22 kids are dead but they focus all their time on this stupid love story. It feels like it was written by a teenager who thinks everyone cares about their relationship when in reality nobody but your parents do. I feel like Cato, Thresh, or Rue (but with a different actress) should've been the lead.",

    "text": " Warning-Spoilers, mention of sexual violence, possible unpopular opinion Both the original and the new one are basically the same, and they are both retelling Romeo and Juliet. In my opinion, it shows a wildly toxic relationship between two people with love addiction and a distorted view of reality. He murdered her brother, so she fucks him and decides to run away with him? Yikes. Just the speed at which they fall in love is insane. They share one dance and then he stalks her to her house, basically forces his way to her, despite her saying no. (Not to mention the scene where they essentially rape Anita.) While this is not a criticism of the actual acting, score, or filmography by any means, I can't help but feel jaded about Disney's advertisment stating that it's \"the greatest love story of all time.\" If that is an example of the greatest love story, what kind of message does that send to people? That it's ok to fight, rape, and manipulate people. To me, from a psychological point of view, this movie is an example of racial intolerance and love addiction. It's a comment on how one voice doesn't matter in a world fueled by hate and violence. I feel if we can change the narrative from the greatest love story to an example of hate, it can be a lesson to people, but as it is now, the advertisement make one think, it's ok to beat the out of a shit human if one gets their way, and I don't think that's the message that should be shared, especially with young minds that may easily be influenced by the media. I would really like to hear other points of view regarding this, if anyone cares to share.",

    "text": " I remember sitting down in my room late at night bored out of my mind, and saw Coraline was on tv. My inner voice was like “ugh, this weird movie” but I sat down and watched it, and thought it was incredible. Took me like a decade to decide it’s my favourite film. But I actually think about it every week. It’s the only film that I’ve done that with since I’ve seen it. And I think the reason why is...story is great. But I’ll forget the plot of a film, I’ll forget the characters names. But imagery sticks in my brain. And Coraline has such a great use of imagery. The use of colours depending on which side Coraline is at. And the art of stop motion, just has this fantastical eerie feel to it, that I don’t think other styles of animation can capture. And my god is it the smoothest I’ve ever seen stop motion done in a film. And another reason. I’m in love with films that take place in reality, with just a touch of fantasy. Whether literally or not, featuring a portal between the fabric of reality and fantasy. Another great film that does that is Edward Scissorhands. There are many great films. But only a few films that can capture the magic of a Tim Burton or Henry Selick.",

    "text": " So, I want to get a lot of stuff out of the way at the top. It's filmed badly, the sets have no character, there is no art to cinematography. It's structurally bad. We are introduced to the crew of guys/gals early on in the film, for the first 30 minutes...and then they are abandoned for 50+ minutes while Final Girl goes on her fetch quest to recover other Final Girls/Guys from the original films. Speaking of the fetch quest...they did no favor to these actors. They look like dried out husks. I guess it's intentional? I'm getting ahead of the horse here. The point of a Scream film, is to note tropes and create rules...with a twist. That's the 'fun' and ironic element to a Scream film. This one does not have this element. The closest we get, is a shitty character monologue describing what a shitty reboot/requel is...which is this movie. So, it's on point in some ways... but I don't know that the creators meta observation that their film is garbage is that observant or interesting? It definitely isn't entertaining. So, this film literally has no rules. That's already a problem. They weakly shoehorn in a 'rule' kill twice in the film, and they don't feel earned or earnest or honest. Most importantly, they aren't fun. There are disturbingly jarring elements to the film, like the 'buddy cop' thing with Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox. Nobody enjoyed this Lethal Weapon. There is a glimpse of a good idea here, where I was convinced that the sister orchestrated everything, so that she would be immortalized in her death as an iconic scream queen death like Drew Barrymore. It's artless, it's heartless, it's no fun, sucks...there isn't even a twist, and there are no rules. The film even tells you 30 minutes in, that intends to be garbage.",

I'm 32, Annie Hall was much before my time, but I watched it yesterday, and I thought it was quite good. I get for how in the time it was also extremely well revered and I thought held up. However, for me, the biggest thing in the whoollleee movies was Christopher Walken's scene in the movie, very short, but insanely impactful to me because I have thought the same thing a thousand times and I've never understood why, maybe I should google it. If you haven't seen the movie, Christopher Walken's character says pretty much nothing when he's introduced, and as Woody Allen's character walks by his room, Walken calls him in. He starts to talk to him about how at night, when he is driving, he has an urge, to swerve into oncoming traffic and go head on in the car in front of him and proceeds to go into a little more detail. It's very caught off guard for a romantic comedy drama movie that comes out of nowhere. The biggest thing to me is I've always had that daydream myself, and I've never really talked to anyone about it or looked it up to see what the whole thought process of that is or could mean. It's not a suicide type thing, to me I've more or less thought it to be what it would be like I guess for something that you know is obviously insanely dangerous, and to see what that would be like. I was wondering if that scene caught anyone else off guard, and if anyone else has had that thought process and pleasantly surprised when it popped up. Also, I side note, I just watched Almost Famous, I had seen the Tiny Dancer seen of course, but never the full movie. I'm glad I finally saw it. But I almost wish I would've seen it a couple years after it came out cuz I would've been the William's age and I think it would've impacted me differently.

First off the casting is absolutely amazing (I mean Jason Issacs and Steve Buscemi and Michael Palin in the same movie?!) and the lack of accents just sets up the absurd tone so well. The actors aren’t forced into doing a Russian accent so they can really nail the comedic timing while still maintaining a serious but somehow also goofy tone. Put all that together with excellent writing and directing and you end up with a perfect dark comedy. The icing on the cake, for me at least, is that it’s also reasonably historically accurate. Stalin really did have a stroke and spent the night in a puddle of his own piss because people were terrified to disturb him and then died because he killed all the competent doctors in one of his purges. Lavrenti Beria really was the monster he’s portrayed as and Khrushchev really did use humor to seem non-threatening before successfully rising to power instead of Malenkov. Those are just a few examples but the list goes on. 10/10 movie IMO and you should all go watch it tonight in celebration of the death of one of the most despicable people to walk this earth.",

Also really wish they could have had Voroshilov in there, he was a pretty central figure in the power struggle (At the time of Stalin's death he was the oldest living friend Stalin still had that was politically relevant).",

Relating to the accents, Ianucci deliberately had distinct accents to not only show just how vast the Soviet Union was, but also there are Easter eggs for British people in the geographical stereotypes of some of the accents (Zhukov is very North West, Beria is RP, Molotov is from Yorkshire).",

Jason Isaac's gruff northern tones were absolutely perfect for his gung-ho gun toting Marshall Zukov.",

I love watching irreverent films at home. Truth be told I love watching action films at home too, but the theater experience is reserved for me as an experience, not just a place to watch film. I don’t get an “experience” at home. I get a film to enjoy and that’s that. When I’m at the cinema, I want explosions and action that rattle my bones and get me hyped. I want an experience that makes me want to sit next to a bunch of obnoxious randos who chew with their mouths open and smell like BO. Wes Anderson, or licorice pizza isn’t gonna do that, but spider-man going thru the multiverse with dr strange just might. So, dear film makers, please do continue making amazing films of all budgets, just save the big ones for the theaters and let my Netflix subscription handle the rest. Maybe an unpopular opinion but I stand by it.",

    "text": " I'm a busy college student, and sometimes it doesn't help that one of my ways to destress, aside from reading, is to watch movies. Seven Samurai has been on my watchlist for who knows how long, then I finally found the motivation to see it recently, but it's 3 and a half-hour long. A long-running time isn't supposed to be an issue for me since on a normal day I would just pop on the CD and before I know it, I've finished the whole thing. But the other part of my brain keeps reminding me that I need to study for my upcoming exams, so I've put the movie on hold for a while, but I've also been preoccupied with my piled-up assignments the entire time, so I haven't been able to return to it. What frustrates me is that it was the first time I wasn't able to finish a single film in one sitting! For me, it's either watching something and finishing it or not bothering at all if I can't bring my whole attention to it. I remember the whole premise before I paused the film but I feel like cutting it into parts somehow would ruin how I feel about it in a way that it doesn't when I watch the entire thing at once. So far I've been enjoying the Seven Samurai but I still think it's merely because I'm not forced to finish it if I have other important things to do. And also that maybe I would have regarded the movie as boring had I watched it in one go. But now that I've settled in viewing it by parts, it seemed to me that it doesn't count, or that I cheated into completing the film.",

    "title:": "Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the . I watched all of them.",
    "text": " A couple of weeks ago, I showed my son National Treasure, and the whole time I kept thinking “damn, I really miss Nic Cage”. I knew that he was pretty much in the DTV world for the past 10 years, but I didn’t realize to what level. Turns out that Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010’s, and almost immediately, I was determined to watch every one of them. So I did. In no particular order: The Trust. 7/10. A not half-bad way to start things off. It's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and Elijah Wood play well of each other. Cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. There's a good story here but it's never fully realized. We are treated to a Cage Out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go. Kill Chain. 8/10. This one was really enjoyable It's sort-of 3 different stories or vignettes that all come together in the second half, which is where Cage enters the picture. He never Cage's Out, playing pretty restrained the whole time (though there is one moment where he comes close). The writing's a bit ham-fisted, and the characters are pure stereotype, but it's well crafted and a very entertaining 90 minutes. So far so good. With 27 to go, things are looking up The Runner. 5/10. Unfocused and uneventful. It’s well cast and there’s a feeling of “this is a real movie” but it wants to be too many things. There’s a decent movie buried in here, but at a brisk 82 minutes, it’s hard to find. There’s no Cage Rage on display here, instead playing it very understated. It’s quality acting though. Three films into this little odyssey, and so far these are more than just paychecks for him, doing the best he can with what he’s given. Rage. 6/10. It’s OK, but it’s sloppy. The whole time I’m wondering why nothing seems to piece together, and it’s ultimately all in service of a shock ending that undermines everything that came before. Once again, Cage is solid in this. He keeps things entertaining where others may have had me checking out. One intense Cage Out, but I expected more based on the title and premise. Nevertheless, we journey forward. 4 down, 25 to go. Between Worlds. 10/10. I’m going to be fast and loose with the spoilers on this one. Joe is a down-on-his-luck truck driver who lost his wife and kid to a house fire some years prior. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Joe is at a gas station pit stop where he finds Julie being choked out by some dude. Joe steps in and knocks him out, much to her dissatisfaction. Why? Because 1 hour prior, her daughter was in a motorcycle accident and is now in a coma, and because of a childhood incident, knows that if she is unconscious she can cross over to “the other side”. So her plan was to have some rando choke her in a rest stop bathroom so she could guide her daughter back to the land of the living. Joe interrupted the process, so he offers to give her a ride to the hospital. Once there, she asks Joe to choke her in the hallway so she can try again to reach her. “Something” goes wrong, and instead, Joe’s dead wife is brought back in the daughters body. The next 30 minutes see Joe moving in with Julie and playing house while dead-wife-in-daughter (DWID from this point on) slowly creeps around trying to seduce him. It’s the halfway point when Joe is made aware what is happening, and by extension Julie and the movies 1 other character. They all accept this very easily. It’s around this time that we get to a scene where Joe and DWID are fucking, interspersed with a scene where Joe and his wife before she died are also fucking. In both of these scenarios, his wife wants him to read poetry while they fuck. The poetry Joe proceeds to read in both scenes is from a book titled, I shit you not, “Memories by Nicolas Cage”. More stuff happens, and at the end of the movie, through various circumstances, Joe is doing a classic Cage scream-cry, one arm hugging a jack-in-the-box that presumably belonged to his daughter, and in the other, he is dousing himself in gasoline. He then lights a cigarette, which of course ignites his entire body, and he smokes in a completely normal manner while his body burns. This all happens while Leader of the Pack is playing, a song that holds absolutely no significance to anything that has come prior. Throughout, music that feels directly ripped from Twin Peaks is playing, and the whole atmosphere is begging to feel like David Lynch. Is the kind of movie you would find on Cinemax at 2am on a random Wednesday in 1995. It’s fucking glorious. At this particular moment in my life, my greatest fear is that with 24 films to go, I will never again reach these heights. Inconceivable. 7/10. It’s your typical nanny-isn’t-who-they-seem-to-be sort of deal, but it’s actually entertaining enough. It’s all pretty rote stuff, but there’s nothing offensively bad here. Cage gets 4th billing, with absolutely nothing to do other than play the can’t-see-what’s-really-going-on husband. He’s still decent at it, but this actually does feel like a paycheck movie for him, given that I can’t find any reason he would have looked at the script and thought he had something interesting he could do. The Humanity Bureau. 3/10. Lame, cheap, uninteresting near-future story that doesn’t have anything new to say that hasn’t already been said better in dozens of other movies. Cage is actually asleep at the wheel on this one, just kind of making his way through. In fairness, he isn’t given anything to do. Thus far, these movies have managed pretty decent supporting casts. Here though, it’s pretty much Canadian TV extras. Things are starting to feel rocky with 22 left. Outcast. 4/10. Meh. Anakin Skywalker is a 12th Century Knight escorting hunted royalty to safe haven. It’s surprisingly not as cheap as I expected, but it’s a completely unoriginal and boring movie. My only reason for watching, Sir Nicolas, does not even enter the picture until the final 30 minutes. He really hams it up with the old English accent, but he can’t save the movie at this point. Things are gonna need to start turning around soon. Maybe a Between Worlds injection every 3 movies. Primal. 6/10. A movie where a Jaguar, a killer and Nicolas Cage are all loose on a boat in the middle of the ocean should not be this dull. It’s no fault of Cage, who hurls some great insults throughout when not chomping on a cigar, and the rest of the cast seems game (except you, Jean Grey), so it really comes down to the film itself, which just doesn’t use its premise to the fullest. The whole thing is visually bland, too. It’s so muted it borders on black and white sometimes. I had high hopes going in, but thanks to this little journey of mine, I now know director Nick Powell from yesterday’s Outcast endeavor, and as soon as his name popped up in the opening credits, those hopes came crashing down. Running with the Devil. 7/10. Flawed and sloppily made, but still entertaining enough, mostly due to its surprisingly A-list cast that never gets to do much. It's not nearly as cool as it wants to be though. What Feast made a great joke about in its opening few minutes, this movie tries to do for real, to eye rolling effect. Cage is very low-key in this, with Laurence Fishburne of all people having the most fun. His characters sexual proclivities serve no purpose, and an early montage of them would be pointless if he wasn't so much fun to watch. Perhaps the biggest disappointment though is that Nicolas Cage and Adam Goldberg get some screen time together, and rather than take this opportunity to have them out-anxious each other, nothing comes of it. I'm so d-d-d-d-d-disappointed. A Score to Settle. 8/10. Went in expecting a typical revenge flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see something more. Cage is really great in this, and I'm more and more impressed by him with each movie. He really disappears into each role, never doing the same thing twice even if he sometimes is playing similar characters. There are a few moments of the Cage Madness here, much in the same way that Christopher Walken or Sam Rockwell try to dance in every movie they do, but the more subdued acting takes center stage. The Frozen Ground. 8/10. Tight cat-and-mouse type that focuses on the procedural more than the thriller aspect and is better for it. Cage is in top form, and Cusack ain't half bad either. Might I want to dip my toe into his DTV output next? Perhaps. 17 to go first. 211. 1/10. Jesus Fucking Christ. Dying of the Light. 6/10. Dark. 7/10. As it exists in its official form, it’s a middling CIA thriller with an intriguing Cage performance being the most interesting part. In it’s “Director’s Cut”, which is even less of an actual movie than Donner’s Superman II, everything is much more intriguing, and had Schrader been able to make an actual final cut, this could have had the potential to be great. The concept of a dying CIA agent spending his last days trying to catch a dying terrorist is a solid one, but it isn’t fully realized in either version as is. Cage’s performance is a little manic in both, but more fleshed out and sympathetic in the later. CIA business aside, I’d have liked to watch 90 minutes of Cage just losing his mind. Actually that movie could be 3 hours long and still not be enough. Stolen. 9/10. A cheap Taken knock-off crossed with a heist movie that’s a stupid amount of fun. Josh Lucas is gloriously unhinged here, out Cage-ing the man himself. Can the remaining 14 keep up? Arsenal. 5/10. DTV mediocrity that tries too hard to be cool. Cage is hamming it up in a small-ish role, and certainly makes his scenes entertaining, but the rest of the DTV-All-Stars are bland. Seeking Justice. 8/10. It’s packaged as a revenge thriller, but it’s much more in line with 13 Sins/The Game/Nerve. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous, but it’s a lot of fun to watch. It doesn’t use its New Orleans setting as well as Stolen, but the two would make for a hell of a double feature. Dog Eat Dog. 7/10. Weird movie, but compellingly so. Shrader gets his editing jollies off that he couldn’t do on Dying of the Light, but I’m not sure it does much to add to a movie that is otherwise a pretty simple tale of low-level criminals wanting to hit it big. Cage and Dafoe is a great pairing, but it’s never fully utilized, outside of an odd, half-naked condiment fight. Vengeance: A Love Story. ? /10. After the first 10 minutes, where you can fill a card 100% while playing Cop Trope Bingo, you get the deformed child of two very different movies.",

My answer; The Social Network. It might not be my favorite movie of all time, but every time I watch it im blown away about how tightly scripted it is; every piece of dialogue is dripping with character development and moves the plot along.

It hits this perfect blend of drama, thriller, and slapstick humor, in a way that on paper absolutely shouldn't work, but absolutely does.

Francis Bacon once said, \"There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.\" And I think that describes Memories of Murder perfectly. The fact that the real serial killer was identified and confessed in 2019, and watched the film himself, really ties the bow. So that's my argument for the greatest film of all time. What's yours?",

I understand this somehow because grindhouse movies were kind of ”bad” and the image quality wasn’t great. But what makes it so bad? Tarantino also said he wanted to make the best car-chase ever for the film. But what made him later say it was his weakest film. Is it because it didn’t make much money at box office and he didn’t want to be remembered as a director of a failed movie. At the time of the release he said people weren’t aware of grindhouse culture as much as he thought. Interested to hear your thoughts",

I'm talking about deep space travel and not close to Earth like Gravity or First Man. List to complete: Sunshine (2007) , Interstellar (2014) , Solaris (2002), High Life (2018), Contact (1997), Prometheus (2012), Alien (1979), 2001 Space Odyssey (1968), Ad Astra (2019), Not Earth proximity: Gravity, Apollo 13 etc Any movies to complete with ?",

Think about it,If the award shows like the Oscars and Emmys are no longer televised ,People won't get to see them except at least in streaming and the year's Golden Globe demonstrated it when NBC boycotts the awards due to its lack of diversity that the winners are announced through news instead .",

Yes, I am aware about the original version Kingdom of the Sun, and would've I have liked to have seen that version too, probably, but I'm willing to look past it, because the movie we got instead freaking rules. The pacing is very fast and straight to the point in the best way possible, the animation and music are solid, the comedy is very well done as well, I found myself laughing at alot of points in the movie, especially when it came to anything related to Kronk, that dude is awesome, and his line are probably the most quotable in the movie, which is saying a lot since there are many other quotable lines from the other characters too. Speaking of which David Spade and John Goodman do a fantastic job as Kuzco (AKA The Best Disney Princess ever) and Pancha respectively, and the characters of Kuzco and Pancha are great as well, and the chemistry between the two is very well done and believable. The villains of Yzma and Kronk are very entertaining as well, especially Kronk. And while it is a comedy, it Still manages to have great emotional moments aswell, yeah the story is predictable admittedly, and something we have seen plenty of times before. But the comedy and characters manage to breath new life into it. Also that over the top climax and ending are very epic.",

      "Yes, I am aware about the original version Kingdom of the Sun, and would've I have liked to have seen that version too, probably, but I'm willing to look past it, because the movie we got instead freaking rules.",
      "Unpopular opinion: Emperor's New Groove is the funniest Disney movie.",
      "The pacing is very fast and straight to the point in the best way possible, the animation and music are solid, the comedy is very well done as well, I found myself laughing at alot of points in the movie, especially when it came to anything related to Kronk, that dude is awesome, and his line are probably the most quotable in the movie, which is saying a lot since there are many other quotable lines from the other characters too.",
      "The sequel Kronks New Groove is surprisingly good too!",
      "No no no, hold on. Speaking of which David Spade and John Goodman do a fantastic job as Kuzco (AKA The Best Disney Princess ever) and Pancha respectively, and the characters of Kuzco and Pancha are great as well, and the chemistry between the two is very well done and believable.",
      "I love it because it's so unique for Disney. Forever they will be known for their Princess stories, but they actually did one with a Prince that was basically the antithesis of those princesses and would've been a villain in most other Disney films. And they managed to give Kuzco a redemption that felt earned and didn't sacrifice his personality.",
      "That's one of the things I loved about this movie. The villains of Yzma and Kronk are very entertaining as well, especially Kronk.",
      "Shrek also falls in the category for me.",
      "And while it is a comedy, it Still manages to have great emotional moments aswell,",
      "This movie has a lot of heart but it never tries to hit those heavy emotional beats like Disney movies today do. It sets out to be a comedy first.",
      "yeah",
      "Got that it was different and more absurd and broke some rules. Also much under-appreciated, around that time: Atlantis, The Lost Empire. Dunno if it holds up, but I thought it looked great, was adventurous, and the humour was weird/fun/edgy.",
      "the story is predictable admittedly, and something we have seen plenty of times before.",
      "It’s essentially Disney’s stab at Looney Tunes humor, which makes it easily the most entertaining Disney animated feature for me.",
      "THANK YOU."

      "There are six films that I think are almost perfect made between 2000 and 2022 that I think should be classics.",
      "It can be any movie from 2000 to 2022.",
      "Films i would say truly fit the 'cult classic' designation would be things like: Phantom of the Paradise, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Slumber Party Massacre II, Freaked, Nightbreed and so on...",
      "I wouldn't say the term has changed. Could be a movie that is already considered a masterpiece but may possibly be more important in the future, an underappreciated movie that may become the new cult classic, or so on.",
      "Gladiator, LOTR trilogy .. .. to name a few.",
      "For example, I believe Under the Silver Lake will become a cult classic in the future (or it may be one already).",
      "The Dark Knight trilogy...",
      "Very important to the genre, but not as enjoyable as they once were. It was heavily overshadowed by the public and it is one of Andrew Garfield's finest, weirdest and one of his best performance I have seen in his career.",
      "the lighthouse for sure... hereditary and joker maybe but im not so sure. I also think Pig with nicholas cage might get some sort of cult following.",
      "It's pretty weird but also quite interesting.",
      "The Cornetto Trilogy already has that kind of cult following, and I can't see that changing. The Lighthouse might be looked back on as a classic."

My concept of time as an adult changed significantly and suddenly the film hits like a truck. The passage of time is no longer just a concept in poetry but it’s something I can sense in my day to day, seeing my parents growing old right in front of my eyes, and this film visualised that in the most brilliant and creative way I could imagine. I think most of us, at some point in life wished for a chance to go back to fix things, or to simply re-live the good old time, just to learned that it’s best to appreciate and enjoy the present. The film communicates that message beautifully. I can’t even begin to imagine the impact it could have on someone who’s just lost a parent/parents. Of course none of us would willingly want to experience that but it’s inevitable, just like the very plot of the film.

    "text": " I just watched this movie for the first time in almost ten years. I remember how excited I was when it was about to come out. After all, a mixture of Adam Sandler and the Apatow crew made my little 19 year old brain ecstatic as I was a huge fan of all that. Not to mention, I’m a sucker for dramedies and stand up comedy. My friends and I saw it at midnight, that’s how excited I was. I enjoyed the movie then and still do now, but many people have always complained about its lenh and how it basically tries to cram two movies into one. Watching it now that becomes very clear why. It does lose steam when the third act approaches because a whole new plot line emerges that just feels tacks on. Which brings me to my main point. This movie would have been a much better mini-series than movie. The whole George Simmons getting a rare blood disease and having to live out his “remaining years” by finding the beauty in life, reconnecting with old loved ones, and simply finding his love of comedy again through younger stand up comedians could have had the time to breathe over the lenh of a season as opposed to a three act film structure. Then the whole third act where he goes to his ex-girlfriend’s house, who is now married with a husband and kids, could have been the last couple episodes. That whole ending wouldn’t have felt so rushed and pointless. Instead, it could have morphed into something more profound. A view on life moving too fast and how some of us just need to move on from things we once felt connected to. Like I said, I still enjoy the movie. I think it takes some unique choices in terms of representing depression and loneliness and Adam Sandler’s performance is further proof that he’s a fantastic dramatic actor. But I completely get why people don’t like it. Most of these problems could have been solved by allowing the story to be longer as opposed to biting off more than it could chew. Who’s with me? Does anyone even give a shit anymore?",

Here are some examples: Dawn of the Dead is arguably both George Romero's and Zack Snyder's best films A Star is Born has been made four times, and only one of them is a real stinker (sorry Babs) While not as good I still think Let Me In is a very good remake of Let the Right One In",

So a common complaint when it comes to remakes is that Hollywood should remake great ideas instead of great movies, something which sounds nice but I've always considered silly because it's not like the original film is erased because of a remake.. That said, there are also cases where great films can get great remakes.",
      "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is a remake of Bedtime Story. The original is great, but the remake outdoes it.",
      "What are your thoughts?",
      "There's just a few where the original film is very good, and the remake is equal or better. Here's a few that haven't been mentioned yet.",
      "Here are some examples: Dawn of the Dead is arguably both George Romero's and Zack Snyder's best films A Star is Born has been made four times, and only one of them is a real stinker (sorry Babs)",
      "I've got friends who aren't that keen on foreign films, so whilst I always recommend the original as a very emotional and feel-good (by the end) film, this is one example where I feel they'll get something good out of a remake too."

It's been probably 20 years since I've seen it, but in all these years I always hear people talking negative about it. Calling it cheesy and had horrible acting. I've kind of chalked it up to just childhood nostalgia and never really went and tried watching it again. Last night I saw it on Tubi and put it on.....I still love it! It feels like a comic book. The look and atmosphere is a complete throwback to comic books. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy, but I mean nothing feels out of place for something set in the 40s. Look at all the old \"I'm going to get you copper\" mobster films of way back, it hit on those so well. Now I'm older and appreciate different types of things in movies, I think it's one of the best homage to older films ever made. The question I have is why has this movie gotten kind of a bad rap, when Sin City was so loved? Sin City is just a more adult style, but the styles are so similar. To me Sin City is the same concept, just more the 70s era instead of the 40s. I think both movies knocked it out of the park, but one is praised, while the other just kind of got left in time.",

    "text": " Anton is a character that a lot of people have analyzed in a multitude of different ways. His ambiguity and moral principles are very much debated and speculated. He's built up authentic villain of the book/movie and rightfully so. He acts as the personification of death but it's not always that simple. In fact there's more than a few times he shows what could be seen as respect, mercy and even a trace of remorse. 1. When talking to the lady at the trailer park after she stayed firm on not giving out Llewelyn's information, he doesn't try to kill her despite her seeing him. Suggesting he might have respected her unbending to him despite her being clearly intimidated 2. He gives various of his victims a chance to live, despite the possibility of them living could as he said in the book would put him at risk. I don't think he kills out of a sadistic twisted enjoyment but rather because for whatever reason he sees himself as an emissary of fate who is obligated to 3. In the book during the dialogue with Wells, a tear flows down his eye after being called crazy. I don't think he felt bad for killing Wells, but the effect of what Carson said having such an effect on him that contemplating himself as a person depresses him. This could show any amount of things whether it be a tragic past or the pain and guilt over the person he's become 4. While killing Carla Jean was unnecessary, he did give her the chance to live on 2 occasions instead of targeting her from the start to lure Moss in. And even though he does kill her in the end., the dialogue and tone exchanged implies he felt no pleasure in doing so and would have preferred he hadn't if fate didn't demand she die 5. In the book he returns the case to it's rightful owner instead of keeping the money for himself, showing it wasn't greed or the money he was really after but loyalty to his employer which is a positive trait in my eyes. Even though Anton is seen as evil, I think there's something more complex and human beneath what he feels he has to do. What do you think?",

I believe that this movie is extremely underrated and one of the most underrated movies in recent times.",

The Avengers We kind of remember this movie as a setup and payoff, and later movies in the series talk about the payoff, but when you get right down to it, the actual battle of New York is just a bunch of vaguely connected Vignettes of characters fighting gray faceless alien things.

    "title:": "There should be a movie starring Vin Diesel and Terry Crews where they (and their group) play D&D together, but it actually acts out the campaign, switching between the table and the setting, a-la \"The Princess Bride\".",
    "text": " I've heard over and over that Vin Diesel and Terry Crews are big nerds who play D&D. I've even heard they play together. Mr. Diesel also seems to have a lot of input into his movies, even having directed a few video games himself. I think with those two in there, there is the making of a phenomenal movie that alternates between a group of friends playing D&D around a table that then has each of those actors playing their characters. Vin plays his character, Terry plays his, the others play their own. Whoever is DMing is also the narrator, and also plays all of the bad guys. It opens like it's an actual fantasy movie: Robert Downy Jr. (because that's who I picture in my head, I don't know if he's ever done anything like D&D) is narrating something about our heroes journey, describing them each and how they came together, and the camera pans over a fantasy village. In walks, in fantasy costume, Terry Crews, Vin Diesel, The Rock, Matt Damon, and Patton Oswalt. Patton could play the halfling bard (who wouldn't want to hear him sing?), Matt Damon plays an annoying min-maxing elf who takes too long to do the math and doesn't role-play enough (when his character speaks, he sounds \"out of place\", think when a character talks in \"Drunk History\"), and The Rock could be \"the new guy\" (playing an ironically physically weak wizard) at the table to guide the viewer through some of the basics. His charater is still jacked, but he can't do something simple like push a small boulder or lift a tiny wooden cart because his strenh stat is 8. At the end of the introduction, Terry Crews objects to the description of what he is wearing. It cuts to a big table at one of their houses, everyone sitting around with their character sheets, the board in the middle has their pieces on a graph sheet. Dice everywhere. RDJ has his secret divider set up and the rule-book out in front of them, and they argue about their starting equipment for a minute. RDJ finally caves and it cuts back to the characters, and Terry's character is wearing the \"correct\" armor now. I would love to see that. The fantasy parts would be taken seriously like it's an acted out D&D campaign, but it also has the realistic out-of-character relationships and discussions that make up a really important part of any campaign with friends. Plus, I want to see Terry Crews roll a dice, get a perfect 20 and get really excited and start yelling, then cut to Crews in full body armor swinging a broadsword and chopping off an ogre's head in one blow and still yelling, then cutting back to Crews IRL again standing up, yelling, then looking around awkwardly and realizing he got too excited. Every villian would be the DM (RDJ again I think just fits, he's just smug and arrogant but also friendly enough), the Ogre is a CGI RDJ, the thief in the hood is him, the big bad monster at the end has his voice. And of course, he's also the narrator. It has comedic potential, it has flashy action and CGI, it has big-name actors doing something ironically nerdy but somehow believable. I think it would make money, what with Hollywoods insistence on making a movie adaptation of everything, but I don't see a D&D movie ever working without acknowledging that it's all still \"pretend\" on some level. Everyone knows D&D, and I read recently that its use in \"Stranger Things\" has led to an increase in sales of D&D stuff lately, so the timing is perfect, too!",

This film is truly a love letter to film. Originally meant to be a one-off joke for a college assignment, Parker's classmates loved it so much that they wanted to see more. Over the Spring of 1993, he and his friends raised $125,000 to create the film in its entirety, devoting so much time to it that they ironically failed their \"Film History\" courses in college. Based on the true story of Alfred Packer, it was filmed on-location in Colorado, with courtroom scenes filmed in the actual court where the real Alfred Packer was sentenced to death. You can tell as the film progresses that the actors and team love their craft. There is a warmth and sincerity to their acting, and each of the characters are very memorable on their own.

    "text": " I am far from PC but I am so tired of seeing the same tropes repeated over and over. Free Guy is a great movie but it's not free of the cultural biases that never seem to go away. It is centred on a white guy. Within minutes of the film's opening, we discover that the white guy has a black sidekick. Then shortly after that we are introduced to the character with the British accent. Does Hollywood ever tire of using this same setup? It's always the main white character, with incidental black characters, and someone with a British accent. The world is far more than black and white. There are a couple of Asian characters who are simply in the background and I could not find one distinctly Latino character. Latinos are the largest minority in the US yet somehow there is no Hollywood rule that says they must appear in every movie as there seemingly is for blacks. I love that blacks are part of the movie industry. I want MORE diversity so there is real inclusion. Lastly, whether conscious or not (and we are all influenced by the unconscious dynamics of our culture far more than we realise or want to admit), the tired and ugly trope that any homosexual or implied homosexual display must be followed by physical violence. I'm talking about the initial encounter between the black security guard and the Dude near the end of the film that falls directly into this trope. So unnecessary and disturbing. Thoughts/comments?",

But he has also had the pleasure or displeasure of working alongside so many iconic actors and actresses. I can't think of anyone else that has shared the screen with the likes of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Robert Mitchum, Dustin Hoffman, James Woods, Jack Nicholson, Sean Connery, Gérard Depardieu, Christopher Walken, Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Jerry Lewis, Jane Fonda, Sean Penn, Robin Williams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mickey Rourke, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Angela Bassett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, Edward Norton, Joaquin Pheonix, Anne Hathaway, etc. The list goes on... I know he gets alot of flak for his choices the past 20 or so years but it is impressive he has worked with so many talented people and vice-versa. EDIT I'm talking about the privilege of acting alongside actors/actresses rather than just being part of an ensemble cast and not even working with actors in the same film.",

The opening was fantastic and the soundtrack was really good but everything else was meh. The dialogue was unnatural, a lot of the tension felt contrived, and the romance was unnecessary and cliched. Another was The Tree of Life. I love Terrence Malick. The Thin Red Line, The New World, Badlands, and Days of Heaven were all incredible, but I can't say the same for The Tree of Life. It looked heavenly, it had very interesting themes, and the first act was superb. However it lost my interest in the second half where it resembles to conventional family drama. I also want to add The Royal Tenenbaums. I like Wes Anderson in general but there wasn't anything interesting about Tenenbaums.",

    "text": " Screen is black. The iconic MORTAL KOMBAT scream echoes throughout the theater. We are introduced to the (now famous) Mortal Kombat techno theme as the New Line Cinema plays across the screen. But it doesn't stop there. We are then introduced to the mirror-like Mortal Kombat dragon. The techno music continues hammering down upon the audience as the announcer rattles off \"FIGHT\" and \"EXCELLENT\". Flames erupt throughout the dragon logo as the camera pans slowly around it. A fireball explodes towards the audience revealing the Dragon in its entirety. Letters fly towards the logo like blades. They slam sideways to expose the words MORTAL KOMBAT as the scream reverberates across our ear drums one final time. Fire erupts from the bottom of the screen and we suddenly find ourselves staring at a battle arena. We don't need an introduction. We don't need any klunky exposition. One look at the fantastic Cary Tagawa and we know. We know from just how he holds himself - the arrogance upon his face, the magnificent leather cloak he is wearing - we know that this is Shang Tsung. And opposite of Shang is this unknown character of whom we feel immediate pity. The way he holds himself, the fear upon his face, the shaky way he fights - we have no idea who this character is but we know that he is in over his head. This is not some arrogant fighter who feels as if he could defeat the deadly Shang Tsung. This guy is fighting out of desperation. Shang defeats him without a second thought. Without breaking a sweat. There are no grand speeches. No dialogue except for the other fighter begging for his life. There is no exposition. There is just the simple brutality of Shang Tsung absolutely destroying this poor fighter. Then we watch as Shang (grinning maliciously the whole time) crushes the man's spine. He grabs the fighter by the hair and finally speaks. \"Your Brother's Soul is Mine. You...will be next.\" Brother screams. Shang's face warps into a horrific zombified corpse giving us a proper jump scare. Cut to movie. & x200B ; GOD DANG was this just perfect. Two minutes. Two minutes from the opening scream to the death of Liu's brother. We get the memorable Mortal Kombat theme, the classic opening logo, and a perfect example of Shang Tsung's power without any need for exposition. I will die on this hill but seriously; the opening for Mortal Kombat is perfection.",

I'm not gonna front, as much as I enjoy it, the book isn't for everyone. There are certain aspects that are a bit uncomfortable. I think the film did a good job of simplifying the essentials of the books, the fundamentals of the characters, effectively conveyed their pain, and toned down on the more uncomfortable elements. Even without the context of the book, Bana and McAdams were just so likeable. The film managed to understand what the book was about and still make it accessible to a mass audience. Another is Beastly. I absolutely preferred the book, why A Kiss in Time by the same author isn't a movie yet is beyond me. I even preferred the they had that was closer to the book. Some of the asthetic choices were down right weird, and the pacing could've been a lot better. But, I guess I can't complain too much. They did their job of portraying what the book was about in its essence. Plus the actors were pretty solid. Finally, this is a bit of a cheat, the Great Gatsby movies. The Great Gatsby is my favorite book of all time and I don't think either film adaptation perfectly encompassed it. However, they were still extremely faithful and I would have no issue showing either to someone who isn't a reader. Again, a bit of a cheat since there are very few books in this world that can be PERFECTLY translated to screen and this is basically the right idea.",

The perfect film for him to do in my opinion would be a future Jurassic Park Sequel. He can finally bring his Aliens with Dinosaurs film to life. For those who don't know what I mean by that is that James Cameron tried to buy the film rights to the first Jurassic Park book but Steven Spielberg beat him to it by a few hours. He admitted that he wasn't the right man to make the film since Steven made the film for kids and James would have made it like Aliens. Honestly he is right but I still would love to see his Aliens with Dinosaurs Jurassic Park film someday. It would be amazing. What do you think? Should James Cameron do a non Avatar film between 3 & 4 and be a Jurassic Park Sequel or should he only focus on Avatar projects until he's done? Let me know in the comments below.",

On the OPs point about dinosaurs, there's a great IP from called flesh about cowboys from the future who travel back in time to hunt dinosaurs because the future doesn't have enough food.",

      "James Cameron should only ever do the projects he personally vested in. It’s why those projects end up being so good. If he wanted to direct anything else he would, but he doesn’t and him directing anything else just so the franchise could have his name associated with it would be a mistake.",
      "If he hasn't earned that who has? He admitted that he wasn't the right man to make the film since Steven made the film for kids and James would have made it like Aliens.",
      "But there's no way he'd do anything with Jurassic Park.",
      "Honestly he is right. but I still would love to see his Aliens with Dinosaurs Jurassic Park film someday.",

      "What do you think?. Should James Cameron do a non Avatar film between 3 & 4 and be a Jurassic Park Sequel or should he only focus on Avatar projects until he's done?",
      "A James Cameron western might be fun, don't see too many of those these days."

    "title:": "Every character in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 is incredibly stupid.",
    "text": " This movie actually made me mad because of the character's logic. They couldn't make a SINGLE rational decision the entire movie. For starters, why are the characters always approaching the house that Leatherface is in, knowing that he is in there? The Texan guy just got into the house carelessly like nothing bad can happen to him, guess what? He fucking died. And their decision to not call the police was probably the stupidest thing to do, they literally saw a man with his face slashed and they decided to chill on their bus instead of driving away to get help. And even worse than that, they didn't even call the police in the first place. Even though the Texan guy clearly told this girl to call the cops. She just went back to the bus and did absolutely nothing about it. The best thing to do is to drive away and alert authorities. Because being close to the danger doesn't help the people that are in danger, it just endangers more people. Now, do you remember Sally from the first movie? The one that ran away. She came back to kill him and get her revenge. Now the main problem with that is that she does everything wrong in the process of attempting to kill him. She dealt with him once already, then why the fuck are you making the stupidest mistakes possible. First of all, you can see she goes inside the fucking house. WHY? Why the fuck would you go inside the house, lure him outside. This is clearly the right thing to do in the situation. It was already established that he gets lured by noise and he will get outside of the house. And it's much much easier to deal with him in the open space instead of in a cramped house. Because you have a gun you can get far away and get a clear advantage. Because Leatherface is a very physically strong individual your chance of winning him over in a small apartment is heavily reduced. Lure him outside and deal with him this way. After that Sally gives the main characters that have the strongest plot armor I've seen in a while the car keys. So obviously the right thing to do is to drive away and get help, right? Well, they do not think so. Instead, they try to crush Leatherface with this lame, slow piece of junk (AKA Sally's car). He is already busy with Sally, so why deal with him? It will only have negative results. Of course, they weren't able to perform vehicle manslaughter on Leatherface... he has a fucking chainsaw. He could easily harm a vital part of the car before getting harmed. Let's assume they were able to run over him with the car, he already proved that he has incredible sturdiness and can withstand a lot of things. So he has a pretty high chance to be alive after being run over by this slow car. AND because he has a chainsaw he could easily harm a vital part and cause the car to stop working. So now you are stuck with the car not working and Leatherface still being alive. Great situation to be in. There were many more illogical decisions made by the characters because I only watched it once and can't recall all the stupid decisions made by the characters. But yeah, the only reason one person got alive is coincidences over coincidences.",

    "text": " I've seen far too many big blockbusters that were shot in small green screen rooms with poor cinematography (and only one or 2 actors even in the frame), almost entirely CGI/Green screen, and just an entirely fake atmosphere. No Time To Die having such high quality production values meant it really grabbed my attention right from the opening scene. It felt like a proper movie. There were multiple times I was impressed by some technical aspect which I haven't been in a while. How many times do you watch an MCU movie and think that a scene is well lit, or admire the architecture of a village in Italy? Shout out to the audio too. It's one of the better audio mixes I've heard in a while. Reminded me of The Dark Knight (but not quite as punchy).",

    "title:": "Which Steven Spielberg unrealized project would you like to see?",
    "text": " Your choices: Before Clint Eastwood took over the project, Spielberg was going to direct the adaptation of Chris Kyle's autobiography. Spielberg's version would have had a more psychological conflict with an \"enemy sniper\" trying to track down and kill Kyle. Spielberg dropped out due to budget constraints. A Western starring Tom Cruise. Little is known about the project other than Spielberg trying to get it off the ground in the early 2000s. Based on the DC characters of the same name. First appearing in 1941, the Blackhawks are a small team of World War II-era ace pilots of varied nationalities who fight against the Axis powers and other villains/femme fatales. David Koepp is writing the script and the movie will be part of the DCEU. A movie based on Frank Bullitt, the character played by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film. The movie wouldn't be a remake but a new idea centered on the character. An adaptation of the 1951 novel by J. D. Salinger. Spielberg has tried to make an adaptation of the book for years but Salinger refused. The novel details two days in the life of 16-year-old Holden Caulfield after he has been expelled from prep school. Confused and disillusioned, Holden searches for truth and rails against the “phoniness” of the adult world. An adaptation of the 1968 novel by John Wyndham. The novel concerns a young boy who has a relationship with Chocky, his invisible extraterrestrial friend. Spielberg acquired the rights to the book in 2008. A sequel to the 1977 science fiction movie. Spielberg expressed interest in a sequel or even prequel but decided against the idea. A movie based on the LucasArts Monkey Island game series. If made, it would have been Spielberg's 1st animated film. The games follow the misadventures of the hapless Guybrush Threepwood as he struggles to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean. A sequel to 1982's E.T. The movie would have been about Elliott and his friends getting kidnapped by evil aliens, and attempting to contact E.T. Spielberg decided not to pursue sequel. An adaptation of the semi-satirical biography of Thomas Crapper, who, as the book suggested, invented the flushing toilet. A biopic about composer George Gershwin with Zachary Quinto playing the role. An adaptation of the 2001 nonfiction book by Hampton Sides. It is about the World War II Allied prison camp raid at Cabanatuan in the Philippines. Tom Cruise was going to star in the film. Prior to Chris Columbus becoming the director, Spielberg was considered to helm the project. Spielberg's version would have been fully animated and have had Haley Joel Osment voice Harry Potter. Due to objections from the studio and JK Rowling, Spielberg left the project. An adaptation of the 1944 play by Mary Chase. The play was previously adapted in 1950 starring Jimmy Stewart. Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Hanks were considered to play the lead role but the project was ultimately cancelled due to problems finding the lead role. The story centers on a man whose best friend is a giant rabbit named Harvey. A remake of the 1963 horror film with Stephen King writing the script. Due to creative differences between Spielberg and King, Jan De Bont became director and the movie was released in 1999. A biopic about British Army private Horace Greasley who who claimed to have secretly escaped and returned to Nazi German prisoner-of-war camps 200 times during World War II. An adaptation of Lynsey Addario's memoir It's What I Do: A Photographer's Life of Love and War. Jennifer Lawrence was going to star before the project was moved to have Ridley Scott make the movie. An adaptation of the book by David Kertzer. The book is based on the true story of Jewish-Italian Edgardo Mortara, who was kidnapped and forced to convert to the Catholic Church. Oscar Isaac and Mark Rylance were going to star but the project was cancelled due to trouble finding a six-year-old boy to play the film's lead. A movie about American aviator Charles Lindbergh who was responsible for the first solo transatlantic flight. Spielberg's biopic would have been \"unflinching\" and would have explored Lindbergh's anti-semitism. A superhero movie written by Rob Liefeld, the movie would have taken place during World War II and would have been about a man who reluctantly harnesses incredible powers after an unexplained mark appears on his hand. Will Smith was considered to star but Spielberg left the project due disagreements about producing and merchandising. An adaptation of the 1950 novel by Ray Bradbury. The book chronicles the exploration and settlement of Mars, the home of indigenous Martians, by Americans leaving a troubled Earth that is eventually devastated by nuclear war. A movie about the Civil Rights leader. Spielberg bought the rights to King's life story in 2009. However, disputes with the King estate and King's own children have stalled the project from moving forward. A science fiction horror film which was going to be a spiritual follow-up to Close Encounters. Lawrence Kasdan was going to write the script but the movie never got made. Spielberg based the story on the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter, where a Kentucky family claimed that they had been terrorized by gremlin-like aliens. Elements of the projects were later used in Poltergeist and E.T. An adaptation of the 90s manga by Garon Tsuchiya. The movie would have starred Will Smith and was going to be more based on the manga and not the earlier 2003 film adaptation. An adaptation of the adventure novel by Michael Crichton. The story stars the fictional privateer Captain Charles Hunter who, hired by Jamaica's governor Sir James Almont, plots to raid a Spanish galleon for its treasure. A movie about the actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse. The film proposes that the two actresses not only competed for the public's acclaim and attention on the stage, but in their private lives as well. The storyline for the film posits such a head-to-head competition between the legendary Bernhardt and the decidedly younger Duse that the actresses ended up appearing in the same role in the same play on different nights, with critics and the crème de la crème of society attending each woman's performance, lest they become social outcasts. The movie was going to have Nicole Kidman and Marion Cotillard playing the main roles. A $200 million adaptation of the 2011 novel by Daniel H. Wilson. The script was written by Drew Goddard and Chris Hemsworth, Anne Hathaway, and Ben Whishaw were set to star. The movie was put on hold and now Michael Bay is set to direct.

When he later becomes the man's latest victim, the lifelong friendship of the two men is threatened when it becomes clear someone must bear responsibility for their egregious failure to assess the situation accurately. Hugh Jackson was going to star in the movie, reprising his role from the play adaptation of the book. An adaptation of the 1984 fantasy novel by Stephen King & Peter Straub. The book follows twelve-year-old Jack Sawyer who goes on a mystical journey to save his mother from terminal cancer with an artifact known as “the Talisman.” biopic: A biopic about 18th President Ulysses S. Grant with Leonardo DiCaprio starring in the lead role. A romantic comedy with a script written by Ryan Murphy. This movie would have been about a woman obsessed with famous film actress Audrey Hepburn who has left at the altar who then meets a man just as Audrey-centric as she. Téa Leoni and Jennifer Love Hewitt were going to star but the project never moved forward.",

    "text": " You hear many people absolutely hating on film. For instance, Roger Deakins has famously said film is obsolete and not worth paying attention to. Same goes for one Steve Yedlin. However, there have been multiple cases of analogue films that absolutely destroy digital movies. For instance, let's look at 2001: a Space Odyssey - the greatest film ever made. It was shot on 65mm, and it has a very epic and grandiose feel. I have been wanting to buy the 4K Blu-Ray of the movie Lawrence of Arabia. However, it's on Netflix in 4K, so I watched the first 20 minutes. I must say, the 65mm cinematography is a stunner. It's incomprehensibly good. I feel British by watching the cinematography of the opening scenes (with the funeral in London and all) and I have never been to Britain. By comparison, digitally shot movies do nothing for me. Why do people nowadays seem to hate on analogue film and say that digital is objectively superior? Is it unusual to say 35mm and 65mm and 70mm IMAX are great formats that need to be appreciated and liked? What do you think?",

However, I found the acting awful, the plot cliché, and the music disjointed.

I get it was done for plot purposes, but even then, it was gratuitous and incoherent. Looking around the internet, I see a lot of positive reviews and people who consider the longer editions an unappreciated masterpiece. The dialogue and writing was dog shit There was an actual mob character named “bugsey” and someone exchanged pie for sexual favours Someone threatened someone else by saying that they didn’t give a “good fart”. How is this possible? I suspect it’s just film nerds looking for a movie to cultify and because of the political drama around the releases and their cuts. What am I missing? The set pierces were nice, but that’s it. How does anyone like this movie, much less think it’s a masterpiece? I don’t know if I am over reacting but this genuinely might be the worst movie I have ever seen…",

So originally Toy Story 4 was to come in 2015, I was super excited but then it kept on pushing and eventually came in 2019. I was super excited about it I remember on Dec 12, 2018 I was doing some work then I saw a notification on my phone about Toy Story 4 first teaser, I was just so excited I saw that and my hype continued (but Detective Pikachu trailer was released on same day 1 hour later) So i was thinking about that film more. Toy Story 4 was also critically acclaimed, This franchise is probably the most critically acclaimed cause the first two film got 100% on rotten tomatoes, 3rd 98%, 4th was at 97%, that's 98.75% Average! When I saw the film I was definitely about to cry, the tears were definitely on my eyes but they never came out for some reason. I saw some reviews and although no one called this film bad many just didn't like it that much, said Buzz is not good in this, this film sidelines our main cast we knew which is a good criticism. Some said It ruins Woody's character arc and it teaches kids wrong lessons. What do you think of this film? As for me I definitely like this film but not close to the original trilogy level, that's just an impossibly high bar, This series is so legandary, it literally created a new genre of film 3d animation, It has flaws but I don't know why some people hate it so much. I think Woody's character was still brilliant maybe not Buzz but Woody is awesome as ever, people said Bo's character has changed a lot as one of their criticisms too. Just wanted to see what people think of this film, Now that it's been out for almost 3 Years.",

For context I’m referring to studio, tentpole movies - not art house fare. - Have we seen more original cinema? - Have studios taken extra risks by not cutting stars enormous cheques that can be better spent on the movie? - Have films become more immersive because instead of seeing the movie star we have lesser known performers in roles? - Have directors replaced Moviestars as the draw for a film? Has the helped? For me, I’ve realised lately, especially with Top Gun 2, that I just miss movie stars. I don’t want every film to be vehicle for one but I want them back. Sure; many of their films were familiar, but at least they were different stories not so reliant on sequels Look at Tom Cruise; Far and Away, Mission Impossible, A Few Good Men, Interview with a vampire, Days of Thunder, Jerry Maguire. He used is star power to try different things knowing it would draw an audience. The same pattern with Will Smith, Harrison Ford or Stallone. Demolition Man, Cliffhanger and The Specialist are all action films but at least the stories were different.",

I thought it was a brilliant piece of art that ran for years and years on Broadway. Family friendly, sure, but sophisticated and futuristic. Cats is not that. It's a plotless musical about the various hobbies and personalities of cats. I'm not a Cats hater, but boy did I have the wrong impression of that show and I'm still a little salty about it.

      "Antichrist definitely. I got a lot from it.",
      "Dancer in the Dark won the palme at Cannes. It's a classic I think. That and Breaking the Waves are his best in my opinion.",

      "Nymphomaniac was very absorbing. Would recommend next.",
      "I felt ripped inside out by the end. Just finished watching Melancholia.",
      "I like Melancholia for the same reasons you suggested.",
      "No illusions. What a film!",
      "The house that jack built, Dogville and then Dancer in the dark. Nymphomaniac is bad and Don’t watch breaking the waves unless you like main characters that are literal cucks lmao.",
      "The way it makes you face the reality of existence.",
      "The house Jack built, one of my favorite, extremely dark humour. But I’ll suggest The Tree of Life as Companion piece to Melancholia they both have a depiction of what the great unknown and the tiny individual narrative have in common.",
      "I'll watch that today. The meaningless.",
      "Dogville then breaking the waves.",
      "Dog ville it is. The futility.",
      "Dancer in the Dark or Dogville (his best films imo).",
      "The ultimate demise.",
      "Breaking the waves Dancer in the dark Your world will change after those 2 films."

    "text": " I just watched this one earlier today after stumbling across it at a thrift store and, as my title says, I want to know how the hell it is I have never heard of this movie. Interstate 60 stars James Marsden as a recent college grad unsure of what to do with his future who has a run-in with a genie (Gary Oldman) who smokes a pipe with a monkey's head carved into it and who grants him his wish to give him a direction in life by having him deliver a package down the non-existent Interstate 60, which sends him into a phantasmagorical alternate America where he runs into a series of bizarre characters (including a man who can never stop eating and a woman in search of the perfect orgasm) and passing through a series of increasingly weird towns, including one where all drugs are legal and another populated entirely by lawyers. It is a fun, quirky, off-beat movie that has quite an all-star cast which, in addition to Marsden and Oldman also includes Christopher Lloyd, Chris Cooper, Amy Smart, Kurt Russel, Michael J. Fox, and Ann-Margaret, and was written and directed by Bob Gale, the screenwriter for the Back to the Future trilogy. And as I've reflected over the movie in the past few hours what keeps occupying my mind more than anything in the film itself is how it is that a movie that has this much going for it could be such a complete and total cultural non-entity. Interstate 60 is not a modern classic, it is not a cult classic, and as far as I know it is never talked about as a hidden gem. In fact, much like Interstate 60 itself, the film might as well just not exist at all for all the cultural impact its had, but I can't help but feel that, by all rights, this film ought to be sitting in the Arrow Video library alongside other quirky cult gems from around the same time like Donnie Darko or The Happiness of the Katakuris. However, in the film, Marsden's odyssey down Interstate 60 begins when he starts seeing signs that are invisible to everyone else, and so I can't help but wonder if this is some similar sign that only I can see. I really wish I knew the answer but I'm going to have to end there because someone just knocked on my door, some guy smoking a pipe with a monkey's head carved into it. I need to see what he wants.",

Even earlier is 1986's \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" with Whoopi Goldberg which features instant messaging waaaaay before it was really a thing. In the same year as that movie was \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" where the titular character uses his computer to hack into the school's network to change his failing grades. I'm not sure if \"WarGames\" (1983) or \"Hackers\" (1995) count since they're a bit more involved in the sci-fi genre than the aforementioned comedy and rom-com films.

    "text": " So after what feels like Centuries of waiting, we are finally getting a sequel to James Camerons Avatar, titled \"Avatar: The Way Of Water\", and yes I think that is a dumb/stupid title too. Now I'll admit, I am actually pretty hyped for this movie. Because I did actually enjoy the first Avatar, while the plot was sadly the weakest part of the film, since it was just Dances With Wolves meets Pocahantas, but in space. I felt like it made up for it, with not only the environmental themes and message, but also the visuals and the grandeous scope and spectacal of the film as well. Not to mention like Lucas, Cameron is definitely a huge Craftsman and Ideas Man, and it really shows with the first film and it's location of Pandora. So I am looking forward to the sequel. However, I do have a concern. And that with the story. Not just because of the fact that the story in the first film was one of, if not the weakest aspect of the original film, but also because from looking on the Wikipedia page for Avatar 2, the RDA, the Human group from the first movie, are coming back, and are the villains again...why? They were defeated in the last movie so why are they coming back, and this leads to the one fear I have, which is that it will just rehash the conflict of the first movie, minus the parallels to Dances With Wolves and Pocahantas. I kindof wish they would have a new and original villain, or if they were to bring the RDA back, they did something similar to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and have Jake try to make peace with the the humans, only for on of the other Navi to be like \"Fk That!\" And betray Jake, making a nice Antagonist switch, and having it be less black and white, by making a Navi the main Villain. But nope, it doesn't look like they'll be doing that, also Stephen Langs character coming back is weird, since you, he died in the first movie. I guess he could come as a Clone or an Avatar himself, like maybe they resurrect him by transferring his consensus into an Avatar or something, I guess. But idk that feel cheap in my opinion. Idk, we'll wait and see though, maybe Cameron has a reason for the RDA coming back.",

So obviously I was excited to see Heat(1995) as everyone considers it one of the best action/thriller of all time. I watched it few months ago, would not say I didn't liked it(coffee shop scene, gun shots and ending was really good) but I find it a bit overrated. Loved Pacino's performance, De Niro was fine IMO. I just can't understand the hype around this film. In my opinion 6/10 a decent film. Personally I find Irishman(2019) a better collaboration. What are your thoughts regarding heat?

      "The hype is so big with Heat that first viewings are often disappointed (which happened with many critics at the time too, because it was heralded as this huge Pacino/DeNiro team up and they only have two scenes together). On first watch, I liked it but didn’t get the love. Now i watch it almost every 5-6 months and get more out of it every time.",
      "I would say give it some time, and watch it again. I think Heat is great, but I also think it's one of those films that reveals more the... more you watch or think about it.

De Niro's romantic plot was uncomfortable and stiff, Pacino's Family drama was melodramatic and unintentionally hilarious, Kevin Gage's villain was the least subtle and blatantly evil I could imagine, I feel like Dennis Haysbert's story gets a huge amount of focus only to die off almost immediately in an undramatic fashion... like the film gave Danny Trejo's character a fantastic farewell despite barely having a line of dialogue prior."

      "The hype is so big with Heat that first viewings are often disappointed (which happened with many critics at the time too, because it was heralded as this huge Pacino/DeNiro team up and they only have two scenes together). On first watch, I liked it but didn’t get the love. Now i watch it almost every 5-6 months and get more out of it every time.",
      "Will give it a shot. but I find it a bit overrated.",
      "I would say give it some time, and watch it again. I think Heat is great, but I also think it's one of those films that reveals more the... more you watch or think about it. I really enjoyed The Irishman, it is very underrated and people focus too much on the iffy de-aging, but with all that said I think Heat is better.",

    "title:": "My Bodyguard is a wonderful time capsule with some of the most natural acting I've seen in a teen film",
    "text": " I'm not sure how they assembled this cast of relative unknowns, but wow. The dialogue is believable, the way the teens interact with each other feels authentic, and the shots of the Chicago area provide a stunning time capsule of late 70s-early 80s life. None of the actors look like they were selected by casting agents, and none of the outfits look like they were designed for the film. Every scene makes you feel like you are experiencing 1980 as it was. The classical score sets such a peaceful tone without taking away from the visuals and is never used inappropriately. I love how the most intense scenes in the film feature no music. Chris Makepeace had a stunningly unassuming screen presence; it’s a shame his career didn’t take off. Matt Dillon is perfect as the feared school bully, oozing creepiness out of every pore. Future two-time Oscar nominee Joan Cusack steals almost every scene she’s in while making her film debut, and her scenes are both hilarious and heartbreaking (the way the camera lingers on her face in the diner after Moody pretends to ask her on a date). Perhaps most impressive is Adam Baldwin, as the traumatized student who is (wrongly) the most feared student in the school based on his past. If you’ve only seen Baldwin in features Full Metal Jacket, Cohen and Tate (where he plays cocky, confident, abrasive characters) you will be stunned at the range he shows in this film. I’m not a fan of how the Ruth Gordon subplot fits into the film, but we still get both Gordon and John Houseman in the film so I don’t want to nitpick too badly about that. Just a wonderful film full of natural performances and a time capsule of Chicago in 1980.",

    "text": " In preparation for Doctor Strange 2, I decided to watch a Sam Raimi movie I've never seen before. That's where we come to 1995's starring Sharon Stone. Despite a 58% Rotten Tomatoes score, this is still a fun movie. Is it groundbreaking? No. Is it as good as other 90s Westerns such as Unforgiven or Tombstone? No, but it's still worth a watch. This movie has such a great cast. Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, Keith David, Lance Henriksen, and Gary Sinise. This is without a doubt one of Sharon Stone's alongside Casino (which came out the same year) and speaking of Unforgiven, Gene Hackman plays the central antagonist and is just having a blast. It's also fun to see a pre-LA Confidential Russell Crowe and he's I also really like the Lance Henriksen character Ace, who you think is this badass gunslinger with a poker theme, but in reality his claims of fame are exaggerated and The townspeople then steal all the clothes off his corpse like he didn't mean anything. And yes, the setting and story may not be as groundbreaking, but's Sam Raimi's style of filmmaking and the atmosphere really sell the movie. I especially love any scene that involves rain and the way Raimi shoots the makes everything thrilling and tense. Paired with an \"explosive\" finale, The Quick and the Dead is a fun ride that is a fine addition to the Raimi filmography.",

    "text": " Admittedly, not watching the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy was one of my biggest cinema grievances; I had watched Rise of the Planet of the Apes when it had first come out, but I was only 11 or 12 so I couldn't really grasp how great of an introductory story it was. After watching The Batman I finally decided to watch the Apes movies since everyone called Matt Reeves a genius for his direction in them, and wow am I blown away after watching Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Rise was a good introductory film for the series, but Dawn somehow manages to build on every single thing that Rise did well and finds a way to improve it ten-fold. Caesar may legitimately be one of the best on-screen leaders in film history, and he's a CGI character played brilliantly by Andy Serkis. Koba is one of the best villains of the 21st century. The CGI as a whole? Unbelievable. I was mesmerized watching the apes interact with each other, the humans, and with the environment. Michael Giacchino's score is absolutely phenomenal. Everyone's decisions - especially those of Caesar and Koba - are logical based on what they've been through up until that point. It's hard to find anything in this movie that didn't make sense based on everyone's personal motivations. I wish I had seen this film earlier and had been able to watch it in the theater. I also cannot wait to watch War for the Planet of the Apes next after this. It may already be one of my favorite trilogies, this series is special.",

It absolutely perfectly matched the scene, especially John David Washinon's ferocious performance, particular when he runs. I'm wondering - what is everybody's favourite movie score? I really love bombastic, energetic ones as well as more somber ones. Some of my favourite scores are (of course) TENET, Inception, Interstellar, Her, The OG Spider-Man Trilogy, Synecdoche, La La Land, and 2001 (although I'm not sure if the insane choir sections were composed just for the film or if they already existed).

      "To me, they kind of had a same similar path in Hollywood.",
      "Worthinon has Avatar and The Debt, which are both good. Then he has some films that are well made enough that they might hit well for certain people: Rogue is a fun Australian creature feature, Hart’s War is an early period war flick, Sabotage is a bloody cartel flick. Sturgess will always have Across The Universe, and I love Cloud Atlas.",
      "10-15 years ago they were both starring in high budget movies.",
      "The problem with Sam Worthinon was that he was cast in Avatar and hollywood decided he was going to be the next big thing. He got a couple of other bigger roles around the same time. When the movies started coming out, people realized he has all the on screen charisma of a wet piece of cardboard.",
      "They had plenty of lead roles, more than some well known actors.",
      "Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best things Sam Worthinon has been in, and he turns in a solid performance too.",
      "Yet somehow they failed to become household names.",
      "I know you are asking for good movies, but 'The Last Son' while not necessarily good, it features strong acting by Sam Worthinon."

I came in knowing barely anything about the movie aside from the general premise and its audience reception and by knowing little about what I was about to watch the film just kept twisting my expecations and assumptions like I assume a good who dunnit mystery should. For example, when they revealed like barely halfway through the movie how Harlan died, I thought they purposefully subverted a pretty standard mystery storytelling trope in an attempt to perform some sort of genre bait and switch. Especially given how some part of the movie abruptly focused on pretty overt political discourse about immigration, I thought the rest of the film was just gonna be a straight up satire with political themes. The film even twisted my perception of the charcters. Like they made it appear that Craig's investigator character was inept for continuosly ruling out Marta as a suspect given her \"model minority\" appearance. But then at the end they brought it back to an earnest murder mystery, albeit while still being sort of a satire with political commentary. I found it to be such a well crafted murder mystery that was highly entertaining. I legit gasped during the case revelation and also, I just need to gush about how many chekov's guns they planted throughout the movie and how satisfying it was to watch them all go off one after the other like rapid fire during the climax. Also that smug ending was incredibly satisfying.",

I was under the impression it was some sort of slapstick comedy involving an arachnophobe played by Jeff Daniels hiring John Goodman to exterminate his house or something. I was pleasantly surprised. This was a real blast. It felt like it was trying to combine the tones of Gremlins and Jaws, and it succeeded quite admirably. There's some true terror and almost Hitchcockian suspense here and first time director Frank Marshall does a good job with the buildup, letting us get to know the town and characters before all hell breaks loose. Marshall also perfectly balances the horror with some humor brought in by John Goodman's exterminator character who helps alleviate the tension but not to the point where he turns the film into a full out comedy Marshall apparently wanted to recreate the feel of a \"roller coaster\" and this movie does a great job of that. Jeff Daniels is also a great everyman lead and he has great support from John Goodman and Julian Sands. This is basically a B movie with an A list budget and crew. How many horror movies, especially creature features, today would take the time and money to go and film a 15 minute prologue in Venezuela complete with sweeping helicopter shots? This movie did only OK business and has kind of been lost in the shuffle and not as remembered as the other Amblin catalog films at the time (movies like Poltergeist, Gremlins, The Goonies and of course huge movies like ET and Back to the Future) but I'd say this movie deserves to be just as fondly remembered as those films.",

He only existed to defend the insufferably whiny Ally Walker (who was much better in PROFILER). You'd think a movie where Van Damme fought Dolph Lundgren would be fun but it felt so anti-climactic. KICKBOXER is not bad but it's not as great as it once was and I feel the first half shows Van Damme can act when given the chance. Now a movie I love and I think doesn't get the love it deserves is LIONHEART. I think Van Damme gave his best performance in this movie and he handles the dramatic scenes in such a brilliant way, his scenes with Lisa Pelikan are his best as an actor.

      "I thought it weird how the movie kept showing Van Damme's butt in such an obvious way and his character was a empty vessel.",
      "But I also think Van Damme did an amazing job playing twin brothers, giving them both a very unique identity that works through the whole movie. I’d say the movie that I used to love and now can’t really stand is Double Team. As a kid, Van Damme was my hero, and I loved the Chicago Bulls during that time, and originally thought this movie was super cool.",

Watching movies with my kid and Sing is one of the few he sat through (he likes songs in movies). The animation is mixed, some instances are phenomenal and some are meh, but all the subtleties of the jail cell scene are top notch. The whole minute long jail cell scene is just great to me. I love the freaking one second blip at the beginning of the henchmen watching Johnny sing \"I'm still standing\". The goofy smiles on the right gorilla and the gator while their bodies bob (is that the right word?) to the music make me want to smile every time. I could put that one second on a loop and it would be an instant pick me up. Followed by the way the animation that fully sells me on Johnny being really into the singing. Taron's singing voice also sells the enthusiasm. That leads right into his dad seeing and being proud of his son. The facial expressions on his dad's face are perfectly animated to depict the surprise, the joy, and the sudden realization of what an idiot he's been. The animators absolutely nailed those emotions back to back and along with Peter's voice work for the dad. As a father to a young kid, these scenes always get me and this one more than most. It doesn't hurt that I also love the main chorus of \"I'm Still Standing\". Anyway, that was it. I just really had to get it out there how much I loved that scene. Cheesy? Yes. Corny? Yes. But I will proudly claim is scene is one of my favorite of all time in any movie (not my absolute favorite, but definitely ranks high). Just the joy and emotions it draws out of me are crazy.",

    "text": " I saw Don't Look Up this weekend, and it was very good. Witty, relevant, with a great ensemble cast. Now I do watch a lot of science videos on youtube and am very into space and was thinking about Oumuamua the interstellar asteroid that we totally didn't see until it was already on the way out of the Solar System. We have the technologies to track all Earth Crossing objects in the inner Solar System, but might not spot something from the outside, just as shown in the movie. At the end I said to my friend ' Well we just have to hope if something like this happened the politicians would actually be more rational in real life.' And he said, well it already is, it's all about climate change.' And it struck me, I was not reading that at all. I was aware that DiCaprio was an environmentalist and had his say in the script, but totally missed the allegory in the story. I got the political satire of the US administration's attitude to science and business, and just read it as a 'what if' scenario. I think I was just swept up in the caricatures. What other movies did you see and just missed the point until someone pointed it out for you?",

There's no other movie I can think of that has captured such a grand and brutal adventure; TWO adventures, mind you. I can go on and on about how magnificent the characters, the aesthetics/visuals, and plot is, but it would be a disservice to the movies themselves. They've captured something truly different in these movies; something you almost don't want to end when you finally reach it. If you're into high fantasy you've no doubt watched these movies already, but if not? Please do yourself a favor, set some time aside, and dive in. As an aside, I really hope the upcoming show can live up to the legacy that this trilogy has created. Im not even sure what the general consensus on the show is right now but I'm excited. There's so much that can be done with it. It seems like shows are the only way to find such detail and grandness, these days; like nobody wants to make movies at this level anymore!

Sam You know what I mean if you've seen it. Spiderman No Way Home - The Marvel writers have gotten me a few time, Tony... Nat...even the scene with Cap and the hammer with a different and nicer emotion but this one really almost just had me gushing in the theater. Green Goblin, you are truly a monster.

I think it was Val Kilmer's first starring role, and he carries the movie like a champ, including some pretty darn good singing and dancing scenes. Val Kilmer is one of the most serious, best actors the USA has ever produced, but he nails the comedy. I think he might regret this movie a little but IMO it's a landmark achievement he should be proud of. And Omar Sharif, a serious actor, who managed to make getting crushed in a car funny.

    "text": " Recently, I watched the movie, \"Apocalypse Now\". It's a film from 1979. It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, and it stars, among others, Martin Sheen, HARRISON FORD, Robert Duvall, or Marlon Brando. It tells the story of a man who's order to assasinate a renegade officer, who's accused of executing 4 Vietnamese during the Vietnam War without an order. I think it's a truly impressive film. The opening scene features a recording of the song, \"the End\", playing while we are shown images of trees burning and helicopters flying around. \"This is the End... my only friend, the End\". I find this is a really memorable sequence. It sets the tone for the entire. Peaceful, melancholic, albeit sad music is contrasted by the gruesome reality of war. The film's premise is to show that all our civilization is built in the midst of a huge, unconquerable, and overwhelming force - the Nature. All that we have ever achieved as a species rests is but a small raft floating upon a huge ocean of wilderness, violence, sexual frustration, hatred. All that humanity has done is to build itself a rather shaky shelter providing us a temporary cover against the raging storm of wilderness from which we came, and to which we eventually shall return. I think the motion picture does a rather splending job at conveying this message. But what is truly impressive about the film is the cinematography. It's breathtaking. One of the most impressive shots is when Willard, the protagonist, jumps into the river and his face is shown slowly emerging to the surface, all covered in camouflage. I think that's a really incredibly shot, which should be appreciated. I don't know what people will say, but I think it may actually be one of the greatest films I have seen. What do you think?",

In this case, the nightmare it was to get made (the natural disasters that destroyed the set, Sheen’s heart attack, Brando turning up obesely overweight, funding running out, the drugs, the unfinished script, Coppola’s descent into ersatz madness, etc), the multiple cuts and arguments with the studio, the different endings and how they can be interpreted and how they change the tone of the film, how it relates to the book that inspired it, and the documentary made by Coppola’s wife, Hearts of Darkness, which was based on footage she made as filming was taking place.",
      "It tells the story of a man who's order to assasinate a renegade officer, who's accused of executing 4 Vietnamese during the Vietnam War without an order.",
      "I wish Coppola et al had found a way to parallel the ending of Heart of Darkness, which is genius.",
      "I think it's a truly impressive film.",
      "You now have to watch his wife’s documentary, “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse”.",
      "The opening scene features a recording of the song, \"the End\", playing while we are shown images of trees burning and helicopters flying around.",
      "I think the movie as a whole is great but the ending with Brandau improvising stuff is not as great as people make it out to be. He was lazy and it shows. But Coppola did a tremendous job with what he got nevertheless.",
      "\"This is the End...",
      "It's a great movie but not without it's flaws - the premise - though, is based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness to illustrate the insanity of war - also, that first scene you love is actually the last scene when they fire bomb Kurt's jungle kingdom.",
      "my only friend, the End\".",
      "The movie that almost didn't get made. There was heavy drug use on the set. Orgies.",
      "I find this is a really memorable sequence.",
      "But Coppola did a tremendous job with what he got nevertheless but I don’t put it up there like The Godfather I and II.",
      "It sets the tone for the entire.",
      "It went way over budget because they didn't know how to finish it. Behind the scenes this movie was a nightmare to make."

    "text": " After watching for the first time, it made me regret not getting to this movie sooner. It also made me want to marathon every single Brian De Palma movie I haven't seen yet. Now I haven't read the original Stephen King novel, but what really encouraged me to watch this movie is that Quentin Tarantino included it as one his favorite movies in a and after watching it, I can see why. Even leading up to the climax, I was on board with this film. The highlights included watching Piper Laurie's as Carrie's super-religious and unhinged mother. I also really liked Betty Buckley as the gym teacher Miss Collins acting as one of the only characters who was in Carrie's corner. My favorite scene with her involved from the girls bullying Carrie. That woman is a straight savage. Then we get to the We know the pig blood is going to dumped on Carrie and her psychic powers are going to be unleashed, but the tension just keeps building and building. We get to see Carrie start to come a little out of her shell, the prom king/queen vote being rigged, and all the teens getting into place to pull off prank, and then it happens. I love how everything goes silent except for the sound effects; the dripping of the blood and the clanging of the bucket as Carrie collects her thoughts about what just happened. Then Sissy Spacek goes wide-eyed and unleashes hell on everyone. The screen splits and we see all the doors close and lights go out. Then it's constant carnage. People are getting blasted with a firehouse and flying everywhere, a teacher gets electrocuted by a microphone, and even Miss Collins, the only character who stood up for Carrie, gets axed off. Nobody is spared in the destruction. And to add to it all, the stage gets engulfed in flames, creating one of the best images in the movie. I also love the shocked and horrified looks of John Travolta and Nancy Allen as they watch from a window. They also get killed off when try to run over Carrie in a car. Carrie is practically in god-mode at this point. She could move an eyebrow and you'd be completely decimated. Maybe this was one of the inspirations behind the climax to I felt the same amount of tension and the payoff is also widely entertaining. So yeah, I love this movie. Now I'm going to check out the 2013 version with Chloë Grace Moretz. Let's see if it holds a candle to the original.",

    "title:": "Lawrence of Arabia is certainly a great film and it is praiseworthy, but it was not 100% what I was expecting. How would you respond to my observations?",
    "text": " I absolutely loved \"the Bridge on the River Kwai\", which was made by the same director, same company, sharing 1 of the screenwriters, and some of the cast. Now that I've seen it at least 3 to 4 times, I can say it's in my top 20 favourite films. Naturally, I was excited to see \"Lawrence of Arabia\", which is widely regarded as the greater film of the two, while being longer by nearly an hour and photographed on superior film stock. To be honest, while I admit it's a great film, it was not what I was expecting, at all. First of all, it's not really a narrative driven film. Roger Ebert notes that in his review of the film. In comparison to Kwai (which is very much a narrative driven film) Lawrence is more like a spectacle. And I am not saying there's anything inherently wrong with spectacles, it's just I found that for nearly 4 hours of runtime, not much really happens in the plot, at all. I found that the film's story kind of falls apart after the intermission. Lawrence starts blowing up trains. His servant boy gets injured by what appears to be a detonator going off in his jacket (to be perfectly honest, I don't know much about detonators, so I am pretty confused by the scene), and he finishes him off. He decides to wander off with a small group of Arabs. He suffers some kind of breakdown and decides to walk into a Turkish-controlled town by himself (well, alongside Ali). He randomly lashes out at the bey mentioning for his fair skin (?). He gets flogged and suffers another mental breakdown, but reverses his decision to abandon the Arabs upon a conversation with the general. He conquers Damascus, but then gets depressed again and is sent home. The end. I just don't find that the story flows all that well. It meanders a bit into a largely unsatisfying conclusion. Additionally, it's never made quite clear how the viewer is supposed to feel about Lawrence. Did he achieve success? Can his actions be seen as fruitful? I will admit, I read about history quite a lot, but I've never taken a particular interest in the Middle East in the 20th century (of which I am ashamed, but it's not something our school system puts a lot of stress on in my country, nor have I ever had the chance to catch interest, really), so it's not fully clear to me what happens after the end of the film on the the political side of things. However, the movie ends abruptly with the city of Damascus co-occupied by the British and the Arabs, and it's not clear if that's a success or not. Is this a \"happy\" ending? Lawrence also was a different character than I imagined him to be. I actually found him dislikeable. He behaves like a bafoon and constantly seems to suffer breakdowns whenever things don't go his way. He's a total megalomaniac. I thought it was going to be a story of an immature man who grows up with another culture and finds his own worth, but it doesn't seem like Lawrence grows up throughout the story, at all. I actually found Omar Shariff's character much better and more relatable. It doesn't really seem like Lawrence ever truly associates himself with either culture. Or how am I supposed to feel about Faisal? Could be construed that he's an evil man who effectively used Lawrence? It seems the last conversation in the film implies that, which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Couldn't we have gotten more insight into his character? Did he really not appreciate Lawrence in any capacity? Why did Brighton leave the meeting etween Faisal and Allenby at the end? And why wouldn't the British have taken Damascus from the Arabs if they already controlled their resources? I just really can't see what this film was going for, really. What was it trying to say? The visuals, cinematography are top notch, but the main character is hugely dislikeable and the story has a weak, unsatisfying conclusion. I must admit that overall, I like the Bridge on the River Kwai better. I am not denying Lawrence is still a great film, but I can't quite understand what it was going for. What do you think? Am I wrong? Why?",

      "\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" is almost completely fiction (and is based on a novel by Pierre Boulle, who also wrote Planet of the Apes). You need to keep that in mind when watching both movies.",
      "So no, it's not a straightforward war movie like \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" or an epic historical period piece like \"Doctor Zhivago\" (another David Lean picture, and worth seeing, if you haven't yet). It's a war movie, and it's not; it's an adventure movie, and it's not; it's a character study, and it's not; it's a historical epic, and it's not. You may want to rewatch it again down the road with that in mind, and then you may appreciate why it gets accolades.",
      "Where I think the movie may have lost you (and where your criticisms come into play) is that it's as much a character study as it is an epic war film with an overarching storyline. It's not just about Lawrence acting as British agent, unifying the Arabs, winning battles, etc.; it's about Lawrence at war with himself, at war with the British, and about how he tried to be just as Arabic as the Arabs, but ultimately failed.",
      "Where the movie fails is by conflating different historical figures among the Arabs and not really exploring the more complex struggles that were happening as a result of the war. We get Lawrence's perspective, but not necessarily Faisal's, or any of the other Arabs. But that's hard to do in just one movie, and as always, Hollywood sacrifices the history in favor of a story that will work for its audience.",
      "They're both epics, both by Lean, but they're different beasts. Lawrence, Prince Feisal, Sherif Ali, Allenby, etc., were real people, even if the film's characters were fictionalized (especially in Ali's case), and the film was made nearly fifty years after the events depicted, so there were people still alive who knew the actual people, or had been there in the desert during the war.",
      "It's not meant to be anything like Bridge over River Kwai, it's a biography about an extraordinary person, one of only two who managed to unite (albeit briefly) the Arab people.",
      "When the war started, he joined up. England was at its most powerful, as the dominant imperialistic nation on a continent full of imperialist nations, and used Lawrence as a tool to help pull the disparate Arab peoples together long enough to help Britain win the war. Those of you who haven't seen the movie may want to skip the next couple of paragraphs.",
      "Therein lies the plot: the story of how Lawrence molded the various Arabic tribes and fiefdoms into a cohesive unit, and thus into a nation by revolting against the Ottoman Empire, while the British in the background manipulated both Lawrence and the Arab leaders into what was best for Britain and the world order. Even though a lot of the battles were heavily fictionalized, the attacks on the trains, Aqaba, etc., and some of the political storyline was also distorted (especially the Arab Council), the narrative follows what happened during Lawrence's war years.",
      "Lawrence is not meant to be a one-dimensional likeable protagonist; he was a complex man and influenced by the colonialism that permeated the British Army at that time. He's a tragic figure from a war that concluded with both public and secret treaties that carved up the Middle East and set the stage for the world we live in today.",
      "There is also a sequel Lawrence after Arabia if you wanted to get into all of the nuance of court decisions of Britain and France trying to carve up the Middle East with little thought to the people already living there."

You may want to rewatch it again down the road with that in mind, and then you may appreciate why it gets accolades.",
      "Naturally, I was excited to see \"Lawrence of Arabia\", which is widely regarded as the greater film of the two, while being longer by nearly an hour and photographed on superior film stock.",
      "Where I think the movie may have lost you (and where your criticisms come into play) is that it's as much a character study as it is an epic war film with an overarching storyline. It's not just about Lawrence acting as British agent, unifying the Arabs, winning battles, etc.; it's about Lawrence at war with himself, at war with the British, and about how he tried to be just as Arabic as the Arabs, but ultimately failed.",
      "To be honest, while I admit it's a great film, it was not what I was expecting, at all.",
      "Where the movie fails is by conflating different historical figures among the Arabs and not really exploring the more complex struggles that were happening as a result of the war. We get Lawrence's perspective, but not necessarily Faisal's, or any of the other Arabs. But that's hard to do in just one movie, and as always, Hollywood sacrifices the history in favor of a story that will work for its audience.",
      "First of all, it's not really a narrative driven film.",
      "They're both epics, both by Lean, but they're different beasts. Lawrence, Prince Feisal, Sherif Ali, Allenby, etc., were real people, even if the film's characters were fictionalized (especially in Ali's case), and the film was made nearly fifty years after the events depicted, so there were people still alive who knew the actual people, or had been there in the desert during the war.",
      "Roger Ebert notes that in his review of the film.",
      "It's not meant to be anything like Bridge over River Kwai, it's a biography about an extraordinary person, one of only two who managed to unite (albeit briefly) the Arab people.",
      "In comparison to Kwai (which is very much a narrative driven film)",
      "When the war started, he joined up. England was at its most powerful, as the dominant imperialistic nation on a continent full of imperialist nations, and used Lawrence as a tool to help pull the disparate Arab peoples together long enough to help Britain win the war. Those of you who haven't seen the movie may want to skip the next couple of paragraphs.",
      "Lawrence is more like a spectacle.",
      "Therein lies the plot: the story of how Lawrence molded the various Arabic tribes and fiefdoms into a cohesive unit, and thus into a nation by revolting against the Ottoman Empire, while the British in the background manipulated both Lawrence and the Arab leaders into what was best for Britain and the world order. Even though a lot of the battles were heavily fictionalized, the attacks on the trains, Aqaba, etc., and some of the political storyline was also distorted (especially the Arab Council), the narrative follows what happened during Lawrence's war years.",
      "And I am not saying there's anything inherently wrong with spectacles, it's just I found that for nearly 4 hours of runtime, not much really happens in the plot, at all.",
      "Lawrence is not meant to be a one-dimensional likeable protagonist; he was a complex man and influenced by the colonialism that permeated the British Army at that time. He's a tragic figure from a war that concluded with both public and secret treaties that carved up the Middle East and set the stage for the world we live in today.",
      "I found that the film's story kind of falls apart after the intermission.",
      "There is also a sequel Lawrence after Arabia if you wanted to get into all of the nuance of court decisions of Britain and France trying to carve up the Middle East with little thought to the people already living there."

It's so hard to rank them, but personally, I would ranl Fight Club the first (I've watched it over a month now). Reason is I like movies where there are 2 stories at the same time, like in Inception - about their job on Fischer and also Cobb's personal guilts - and Shutter Island - about their job on that mental institution but also Teddy's past.

      "I quite enjoyed this take on Cyrano de Bergerac with the change from him having a too prominent nose to being one of less than grand stature working quite well, as for its change into a musical that was a little more hit and miss for me. I adore Peter Dinklage and it is heartbreakingly painful to watch him pine for his dear Roxanne as the noble Cyrano, but he's clearly not what you'd call a classically trained singer so they had to rely on what is known as sprechstimme \"spoken singing\" for his part which is, I guess, a nice counterpoint to Haley Bennett's more traditional musical renditions. The songs themselves worked about 50/50 for me but overall nothing too bad but nothing too memorable.",

    "text": " By style over substance I don't necessarily mean I didn't enjoy these stories. Just that the stories and their substance were super simple, not meant to dive into the depths of the human condition or examine the duality of man, that sort of thing. These are just movies that are visual and stylistic eye candy, made extremely well on a technical level by filmmakers who really care about giving all their technical wizardry to a film Ocean's Twelve: For a Soderbergh movie, it's not very ambitious or challenging, but the style of traditional caper rhythms combined with comic riffs is one I love. All the actors really have to do is look good and project their personalities. I love all the twist, reveals and double crosses. As well as being a heist movie where the crew keeps failing and being bested over and over again, only to get at the end and find out, this was never a heist movie. It just ends up being a hangout movie where all these specialists are being oddballs together. And still charming. Tenet: I can't praise Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography enough. Just like he was able to do with Interstellar and Dunkirk, he puts the viewer in intense immersion by maintaining realism and naturalistic lighting. Although I've seen him and Nolan's work being criticised as less clinical, I think they produce such beautifully clear images, the way they're able to use moderate focus roll-off and blended layers of contrast allow the lenses to capture pleasing skin tones and a soft, classic overall look. I love the way he and Ludwig Göransson were able to implement the time inversion into the score, especially with the electric guitar, we hear the opening scene at the opera house, we have this low, twangy guitar boom. And I love the ambitious, complex and cerebral inversion narrative, by a filmmaker who's fascinated by our perception of time, and how cinema can play with it. Speed Racer: My third favourite Wachowski movie after The Matrix and Bound, Speed Racer is a movie chock full of visually dazzling, candy coloured, emotionally intense, inventive and visceral racing scenes. I love the way the Wachowskis were able to detach the camera from reality, make the colours so rich and vibrant, that they make a live action cartoon. With endless depth of field where nothing in the background or foreground is ever out of focus. And how, the more emotional the movie gets towards into conclusion, the more unreal surreal the visuals get until those vibrant colours start to blend into one another. I'm not sure I've ever seen a movie that has it's heart in the right place as much as this one. It's the kind of sincere, heart on sleeve display that's looked down upon in these more cynical times. And I love how they tied all this big emotional into every element of the production design, costumes and cinematography.",

    "title:": "Looking for double-features with similarities or common themes",
    "text": " I was thinking about hosting a monthly movie night at my place, using double-features that have some connecting theme in place. For instance, a night of both Fight Club and Office Space- both movies made and set in 1999 about bored white collar workers who have some kind of mental episode (Peter gets hypnosis, the narrator has a psychotic break) to escape their humdrum reality. Or Fight Club and Old School- both movies about middle-class men in their thirties who feel they've lost their vigor and masculinity, so they form secret societies to get their mojo back. On a more basic level, Point Break and its unofficial remake, The Fast and the Furious. Similar to Fight Club and Old School, Game Night was a comedic response to The Game. Clerks and Clerks II, if just because it's rare for comedies to get sequels ten years later, and I thought Clerks II was kind of dark in a lot of places which is kind of unique in comedy sequels (itself a unique phenomenon). Would anyone have any good ideas for double features I could put on? Highbrow, lowbrow, recent movies, silent movies, American movies, foreign movies, G-rated or unrated, nothing's off limits. I will say having two movies with a run time of three hours each might be a little much. I'd like to find all manners of connecting themes, from themes, to \"answer and response\" movies, to comedic versions of dramas or dramatic versions of comedies, etc.",

Also the guy asked if this robot is from some alien race taht was as far as I got from the tone were dangerous and hostile to humans. Also the movie looked like it wasn;t a super old one so I think it's within 2000s but i may be wrong. It's not Earth to echo btw, but the robot looked similar",

    "text": " Two weeks ago I watched Jonathan Glazer's Birth and loved it, so today I watched his first film, 2000's Sexy Beast starring Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane, and Ray Winstone. First off I have to say that I don't enjoy organized crime movies at all. If they are funny or absurd like Snatch, that can help, but straight up mafia dramas are just not my cup of tea. The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of how amazing Jonathan Glazer's direction was on Birth. That being said, this movie terrified the shit out of me on levels that I didn't know possible. I'm still debating on who frightened me more: Ben Kingsley or Ian McShane. Top level performances for both those actors. Direction wise, I'm guessing Glazer wasn't as seasoned or perhaps confident with this film as he was with Birth, but he still has some fantastic moments where he strapped a camera to a car door or to a revolving door to get some unique shots. He also plays a lot with shadow and light to create incredibly intense scenes. One thing I really appreciate with this story were the unspoken bonds between characters, friendships and relationships that didn't feel the need to be spoonfed to us with narration. I had to watch how characters interact with each other, witness their ease or discomfort to define those relationships for myself. Even though the subject matter of this film wasn't all that interesting to me, the performances were top notch and Glazer is truly a filmmaker I can get behind. 10/10.",

The Witch, The Lighthouse, The Northman. Its definitely a three film run that makes you go “damn you really started with these”.

Not necessarily saying they have to have started off with masterpieces, but directors who’s first three movies leave you in awe.

    "title:": "If Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers had switched roles with Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, both movies would've been significantly better.",
    "text": " In Valerian you could have Chris Pratt as the handsome and cocky Special Operative with his sexy, ass-kicking co-pilot in Lawrence. They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get. It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline. On the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger. Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him. I think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat? It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling. I also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that I wanted it to be). Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker: Keep it mostly the same through the first two acts. Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane. Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship. She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted. Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on. That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship. You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.",

He is helped by an imaginary friend (who just so happens to look exactly like his dad) and a few other people, and it it’s a really good young thriller movie. Henry Thomas was just coming off of E.T. and was perfect as the young boy. Dabney Coleman who played the father and imaginary friend was perfectly casted in this role. I love Dabney Coleman and think this is by far the best role he has ever played. The movie was written by one of my favorite writer/directors Tom Holland (Fright Night, Child’s Play, Thinner) and he did an amazing job on this story. Does anyone love this movie as much as I do?",

I lean toward the view that it doesn't have much impact, as there have been older actors who've won the award only for their careers went nowhere after (i.e. Mira Sorvino).",

    "text": " I hate that they have this attitude of \"oh, if those two guys kiss, I won't be watching\" or they leave the screening or get very dramatic. Some because they fear people will think they're gay if they go watch it. Which is kinda dumb. If you know you're straight, then why would you worry if someone thinks you're gay for watching a gay movie? Looks even more suspicious for me. And also, when they act traumatized over watching two men kiss. Youtuber Tyrone Magnus got all \"Vivica Foxed\" over the gay kiss in ETERNALS (which was hardly a kiss, just a peck with no tongue), acting traumatized. Dude, there are explicit rape scenes straight men watch and they never get disturbed by that but a peck between two men is enough to have them running for Rogaine and the Baseball cap. I watch straight people kiss and have sex all the time. Doesn't make me straight and I don't get the dramatics straight men insist on doing when, if you ask me, it makes it more suspicious that they're hiding something. REAL straight men are indifferent to gay men kissing on Film. A real straight guy is not having a Mommie Dearest meltdown because he saw Biff and Randy exchanging spit. There's more gayness in a football locker room than two men kissing.",

    "title:": "Question for international audience members: what is your opinion of American media?",
    "text": " American here. Entertainment media is one of the United States' biggest exports, especially Hollywood movies and streaming service television shows. In other countries, what is the typical reception and attitude towards America's creative/cultural output these days? Even though Hollywood exports movies for audiences all around the world, these movies are inescapably made through an American perspective and with American assumptions. If you are an audience member in another country and culture, do American films these days at all resemble or resonate with your own experience? I'll be honest and show my bias: I'm skeptical of the idea that corporate American entertainment media can respect and satisfy the tastes of every culture around the world. In fact, it feels rather chauvinistic or hegemonic to aim American films towards a global market and expect they'll be universally well-received. And frankly, I just feel that American culture is currently stagnating at a low point of creativity, with our stories being mere remakes and sequels/prequels manufactured by committee in corporate board rooms and focus groups. I'm not the only one within the country who feels this way, but I want to hear from beyond the American bubble. I'm asking with the presumption that America must be an absolute laughing stock right now, when viewed from the outside through our current movies and television shows. I've heard this expressed by a few individuals from other countries, but I'm trying to get a broader sample. From where I'm sitting, as an American within the country, it feels like our media and by extension our culture as a whole has gone completely schizophrenic. Are people in other countries watching our movies and shows and wondering what the hell is going on with us? Or am I wrong, and do global audiences still eagerly consume what Hollywood is selling as much as any American couch potato? International box offices indicate high profits for particular movies, but sales numbers only tell so much. I'm looking for the opinions of individuals. Thank you.",

    "text": " These three are often grouped together as the three big original method actors of the 1950's who were iconic and influential and changed film acting forever. Of the three who is your pick for the best actor? and what film do you feel had their best performance? Although the least remembered and talked about of the three (which is ironic considering he made his film debut first in 1948) I strongly feel Montgomery Clift was by far the best. I love the subtlety and depth he brought to all his roles. His Oscar nominated performances in The Search, A Place in the Sun, From Here to Eternity, and Judgment at Nuremberg are some of the most riveting film performances I've ever seen. He went above and beyond when it came to preparing for his acting roles. Sadly Clift was a very troubled person in real life and after years of drug and alcohol abuse that finally took their toll on his body and he died at the age of 45. He was about to film Reflections in A Golden Eye before he died and fittingly Marlon Brando was the actor that replaced him in that role. Had he not died prematurely and somehow overcame his addiction problems he would have most likely had a comeback in the 1970's similar to the one Marlon Brando had and been better remembered by the general public. I can't praise him enough and I still hope one day Clift will be considered as iconic and influential as Brando and Dean. James Dean is remembered more for being an icon (like Marilyn Monroe) than his film roles which is a shame because his three films were still impressive. He was Oscar nominated for both his first and last screen appearances and both in the lead actor category. He was set to star in Somebody Up There Likes Me and The Left Handed Gun when he died. Paul Newman wound up playing both roles so in a way Dean's death gave Newman his career. Marlon Brando was arguably the most successful of three because he had a long career and is considered both iconic and revered as a great actor. Both Dean and Clift had talent, but their premature deaths and smaller filmographies prevented them from becoming the type of film legend that Brando became and because of that it's easier to see why Brando was the face of method acting and considered the greatest actor of his generation. His comeback in 1972 with The Godfather and Last Tango in Paris cemented his reputation as an acting legend. It's just a shame that Brando stopped caring about acting later on in his career. Regardless all three were extremely talented and they all have deservingly had countless books written about them.",

    "text": " Your choices: A remake of the 1954 Disney film. Fincher was attached to direct the project in 2010 with Scott Z. Burns writing the script. Fincher left the project in 2013 due to casting disagreements with Disney. Fincher wanted Channing Tatum in the lead role while Disney wanted Chris Hemsworth. An adaptation of the 2008 A. Lee Martinez novel. The Automatic Detective is a parody of hard boiled detective fiction where a robot PI foils a conspiracy to take-over a retrofuture version of his world. The project would be a collaboration with Blur Studios. An adaptation of the comic book series by Charles Burns. The story deals with the aftermath of a sexually transmitted disease that causes grotesque mutations in teenagers. An adaptation of the 1980 book by Frank Abagnale Jr. & Stan Redding. Fincher dropped out to make Panic Room. The movie was released in 2002; directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks & Leonardo DiCaprio. A movie set in the world of culinary arts and starring Keanu Reeves. The project was revived and as \"Burnt\" with Bradley Cooper. An adaptation of the 2001 novel by Katie Arnoldi. Fight Club's Chuck Palahniuk was going to write the script. Set in the world of female bodybuilding, Chemical Pink is a story of obsession and the consequences of going too far to achieve your goals. A sword-and-sandal epic about Cleopatra. Angelina Jolie was set to star. Sequels to 2011's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Fincher planned to make the other two books in the series (The Girl Who Played with Fire & The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest) back to back but a movie based on The Girl in the Spider's Web was released instead with Claire Foy. An adaptation of the comic by Frank Miller. The story follows Carl Seltz, an insurance investigator who discovers he is also a homicidal cyborg tax collector who happens to be the last hope of an enslaved robot race. Nicolas Cage was slated to star as the main character. A biopic about Steve Jobs with Aaron Sorkin writing the script. Fincher wanted Christian Bale as Jobs, but both left the project. The movie was released in 2015 with Danny Boyle directing and Michael Fassbender starring as Jobs. A biographical film regarding skateboarders Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams. The movie was released in 2005 and was directed by Catherine Hardwicke. Tom Cruise sought out Fincher to direct the third Mission: Impossible movie. Fincher was looking to make the movie \"very violent.\" The movie was released but directed by J.J. Abrams. An adaptation of the 1973 science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke. Set in the 2130s, the story involves a cylindrical alien starship that enters the Solar System. The story is told from the point of view of a group of human explorers who intercept the ship in an attempt to unlock its mysteries. Morgan Freeman was attached to star. Denis Villeneuve is currently set to helm the movie. An adaptation of Anthony Bourdain's 2000 memoir, Kitchen Confidential. Brad Pitt and Benicio del Toro were interested in starring the project. A movie about two priests who engage in a killing spree after discovering God is nonexistent. The project failed to get green-lit by a studio. Fincher was one of the directors approached to direct the 2002 Spider-Man movie. Fincher described in a 2011 interview concepts he wanted to do in the film, such as a ten minute title sequence tackling Peter Parker's backstory and featuring Green Goblin killing Gwen Stacy. A coming-of-age story set on a nuclear submarine during the Cold War. The script was written by David Ayer who later remarked \"it sucked.\" A remake of the 1951 Alfred Hitchcock film. The project would have been a collaboration between Fincher, Ben Affleck, and Gillian Flynn (so basically the team from Gone Girl) A movie about Col. Wendell Fertig, a soldier serving in the Philippines during World War II. Brad Pitt was desired to play the main role. Fertig organized and commanded an American-Filipino guerrilla force on the Japanese-occupied, southern Philippine island of Mindanao. An adaptation of the true crime comic by Brian Michael Bendis & Marc Andreyko. It is based on the true story of the Cleveland Torso Murderer, and the efforts of the famous lawman Eliot Ness and his band of the \"Unknowns” to capture him. Fincher claimed the movie would be faithful to the comic and it's rumored that Matt Damon, Rachel McAdams, Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman were going to star. A sequel to the 2013 Brad Pitt zombie movie. One of the reasons why the project was cancelled was due to China banning any films featuring zombies or ghosts.",

    "text": " Here's something that I have noticed to be happening, and I can't exactly wrap my head around it. I love physical media of all kinds. Well, not all physical media - I don't give a damn about VHS, for instance, since it was before my time, I barely remember it, and it's trash quality, not to mention movies are often shown in incorrect aspect ratios, etc. However, I do like Blu-Rays, for instance. However, most people have moved on onto \"digital\" (I dislike that term, since Blu-Rays or DVD's also use digital information, so it's kind of an awkward word to use) services. For movies in particular, we've got streaming. I sometimes feel I may actually be the only person within 100 kilometres radius that still buys physical media (books and maybe console games aside) and I probably am not too far away from the truth. Nearly everybody, except for older people who are still using cable (for some reason) is freaking obssessed with streaming as of 2022. However, we can clearly notice that commercial theatres are still alive and doing, relatively speaking, \"fine\". They still exist in people's collective mindset, whereas physical media is largely gone from there. People still go to cinema and people still pay money for tickets. Big releases (mostly comic book films, unfortunately) continue to rack up insane amounts of money. So here's what I don't understand. Why has physical media largely been replaced by streaming, but NOT commercial theatres? Why has the latter survived, while the former is considered to be on the verge of death? Why would one be replace and the other not? Many Blu-Rays nowadays contain Dolby Atmos/DTS:X tracks, which means you can get a fairly great experience at home. Streaming uses lossy compression, meaning its audio is much inferior, but Blu-Rays have lossless compression, meaning it's going to sound the same as in a theatre. In my case, most cinemas in my area are pretty low end, so i would take watching the movie on a good home setup any time of the day. Why? Why do you think streaming has come close to killing physical, but not theatres? Why has one of those survived virtually unscathed - but not the other? Thoughts???",

My favorites are: Anakin vs Obi Wan from Revenge of the Sith, this really is one of my favorite fighting sequence in a movie. The events leading up to the show down was epic Boromir's death scene from LOTR: Fellowship of the ring. It wouldn't be a Sean Bean movie/show if he didn't end up dying. This is one of my favorite death scenes in a movie, from Boromir overcoming being corrupted from the ring to help Pippin and Merry to finally reaching common ground with Aragon and acknowledging him as the king to Gondor. The Fountain's ending, from Hugh Jackman's acting to Clint Mansell's Death is the Road to Awe playing in the background, I feel like I'm in the edge of my seat every time I'm watching everything transpire. Inception Hallway fighting scene, so glad I got to experience watching this movie through Imax, and of course the ending with Hans Zimmer's Time. Once Upon a time in Hollywood ending with the bad guys showing up to Rick's house, Brad Pitt' Cliff saying \" you were on a horsy\" lol, Rick using the flamethrower. Always enjoy the violence Quentin puts into his movies. Fight Club ending, this one gets me in my feels, with the Pixies playing, the way when the beat drops exactly when all the buildings brow up, when Tyler says \" you met me at a very strange time in my life\" Those are the ones that mainly come to mind, I'll add some more if my mind stops going blank. Would love to hear if you guys have any. & x200B ; Update: Thank you for everyone writing and thank you to those who included the youtube link bc now we get to see what it is that you love from those particular scenes with our own eyes :)",

My acting pick would be Javier Bardem for No Country for Old Men. Out of his competition for Best Supporting Actor I don’t think anyone even comes close to touching his take in Anton Chigurh. Best Picture: Silence of the Lambs. 1992 had some great movies but out of what was nominated for Best Picture that year there is no doubt the Silence of the Lambs was the best film.

    "text": " Hear me out: I know we've all heard that age old tired discussion \"Animation is not a Genre\", \"Animation is not just for kids, it's for Everyone\", \"Animation is a medium for filmmaking\". However, my biggest gripe is that animated movies that do invariably get screened and compared together, at least where Western audiences are concerned, DO fit a similar mold. They usually focus on slapstick, fast action, bright colorful scenery, fantasy-like worlds or super bright snarky characters. Yes I know there's nuance, but the cold truth is that the general audience member will watch a trailer to a film like \"Zootopia\" followed by a trailer to another like \"Minions\" and think \"Boy, the humor of these feel awkwardly similar\" without giving it a watch. And my hot take is this: Animation is not a Genre, but FAMILY FILMS and especially CGI ANIMATED FAMILY FILMS, ie movies that make up 80-90% of American animated film screenings are a genre. You know it's going to most likely going to be a buddy film, involving a secret world, with a snarky or sarcastic character that learns a lesson and an optimistic teammate that takes him on some kind of journey. Yes the execution may be different and they may play with the tropes, but the overall feel is similar. It's sad that films like Fantastic Mr Fox, Laika's weird stop motion movies, The Incredibles, WALL-E, or SpiderVerse are the exception where theyre basically adult films simply told through animation. If we want the artform to ever grow, filmmakers have to break out of that 1990s-era mindset that family film tropes dictate animated movie industry.",

    "text": " As a fan of submarine movies, I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to get around to Das Boot. What a film! I was so impressed by how the filmmakers captured so many aspects of life on a submarine, from long stretches of boredom and the irritation of living on top of each other, to the frenetic chaos of trying to repair the ship while depth charges are going off all around. It’s fascinating seeing a WWII story from the German perspective. I loved that the Captain has a distaste for nationalism and politics, which the film also seems to adopt. The men are portrayed neither as cackling Nazis nor as heroes, but as ordinary men, caught up in the insanity of war. The lighting is incredible - reminding me of Alien and Aliens, but at times even more brutal, claustrophobic and horrific. I’ve seen most of the mainstream World War 1/2 movies from the 90s onwards - I’d love to hear recommendations for WW movies from previous decades? Especially keen to see perspectives other than British and American. I really like Verhoeven’s Black Book, for example.",

      "Mark Wahlberg is such a great lead because he already has a shit for brains con artist attitude and he plays a hyperbolic version of himself.",
      "This is a great movie. The Rock is absolutely hilarious in particular and I love the insane, dark nature of the story haha this movie definitely gets slept in because it’s a Bay film.",
      "The Rock hasn’t had a good performance come close to the one in this film in a while.",
      "I loved the Rock as a villain. Not an villain turned anti-hero but an actual fucked up villain who is coked up out of his mind.",
      "Not playing a villain is also part of his contract atm afaik. Anthony Mackie is doing more work in this than in the mcu.",
      "Bro... You need to remember that when Mackie joined the MCU he INSTANTLY became one of the core members in the first movie he appeared in. We loved Sam the second the movie started.",
      "His comedic timing is gold.",
      "An excellent film and boy I love The Rock in his more goofball roles. This and Southland Tales are such an interesting ways to use him. But Tony Shalhoub's role of being the victim but also being a gigantic piece of shit was such a great turn for him.",
      "I also liked him in Be Cool. The three leads are a perfect storm of violent psychos.",
      "love this movie, amazing to think this gem came from Michael Bay."

    "text": " I get it, the last decade hasn’t be nearly as good as the 90’s & 2000’s. Considering his range, and the amount of solid films he’s done. Surely, one decade can’t undo all that good faith. I know he kind of overdid that whole hiding behind make up thing in the early 2010’s. But I mean, Edward Scissorhands, Fear & Loathing, Dead Man, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd, Pirates 1, Ed Wood, What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, Finding Neverland, Chocolat, Black Mass, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Cry Baby, Arizona Dream, Benny & Joon, Blow, Minamata, Public Enemies, Corpse Bride, Rango...He’s got a lot of films that were praised by critics and audiences alike, and I’m sure I’m forgetting a few. His choice to hide his leading man looks, and embrace his inherent very charming weirdness, as well as his beautifully stylistic and whimsical fantasy films with Tim Burton, and equally unique collaboration with Hunter S. Thompson. His career just really stands out to me, and no doubt I’m biased, but it’s kind of sad to me, he’s not really talked about that much inside the film community. Of course he has no shortage of fans and those who praise him, but it’s as if, as far as his film career goes, he doesn’t get the respect I think he definitely deserves.",

    "text": " Myself and my partner watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and we found it hilarious, ridiculous and then just campy shlock (divided into the thirds of the movie). I understand from other people's reviews I have seen here that it is some kind homage to 80's action and slasher flicks but that still doesn't make it work and it would be at the bottom of the barrel for 80's homages. The movie, from the reviews we read on RT and IMDB did not bill this as satire (We went looking again afterwards and couldn't find any that did), so we went into this movie expecting it to be (as billed) a Mystery/Thrill. The only thrill has been the mystery of why this movie is rated so highly... The action was decent, but manically over the top, which jarred so much with the small town feel that it didn't feel threatening or real in any way, just very silly. We were convinced that the actors were deliberately acting badly, everything was so stilted like they were reading off their terrible lines. The movie then became the Avengers half way through which my partner had predicted as a joke at the start. It was so lazy. The 80's soundtrack was bad, trying use it as a tool for jump scares was a bad choice and in other parts the sound editing felt as though it was only half done. After Nick Fury showed up I kind of lost interest, but still watched the rest of the movie as by that stage the bad acting was just getting painful to watch. It was just a laughable mess from start to finish with very predictable plot points and no redeeming features save okay production values, attractive people and some decent fight scenes, which you can all get in almost any 2nd rate action movie.

    "title:": "After watching Troy and Dune , I dream of Denis Villeneuve picking up where Troy left off, and directing The Odyssey with Sean Bean as Odysseus.",
    "text": " Currently reading The Odyssey right now, and this story is just begging for a big screen adaptation in Villeneuve’s style. Dune is the only film I’ve seen of Villeneuve’s, but the way he was able to tell a familiar story of family, politics and war, and weave in fantastic elements of sci-fi and fantasy (with sprinkles of real ancient culture inspiration from the books), just shows me he could put The Odyssey on the big screen with eye-popping visuals and sound design you can feel in your chest. Heck, Hans Zimmer could just use the same score from Dune for The Odyssey. Wolfgang Peterson’s Troy (2004) made the questionable decision to remove Mythology from the story of the Iliad, and instead try for historical “accuracy.” Although classicists begrudged this choice, the story does lend itself for this to be done. The Iliad poem is mostly about the war, with various cutaways to the Gods squabbling over each side, and conversations here and there. The film does hint at the interference of the Gods in human affairs, which would be enough for us to carry into The Odyssey. For The Odyssey, real life mythology would need to come roaring back to the forefront. You could not tell the story without Cyclopes, witches, goddesses, monsters, the whole kit and caboodle. But Denis could tastefully weave in historical family drama with the crazy, out-there fantasy, and on a grand scale too. Because he did it with Dune. The very best part about Troy (2004) is Sean Bean as Odysseus. He carries with him cleverness, wisdom, and a longing for hearth and home, not glory in battle and violence. That’s what The Odyssey is; a story about a world-weary man who just wants to go home to his family. Sean Bean should not be wasted as Odysseus and I believe he is still young enough to tackle the role again. Maybe all I want is to see Sean Bean as Odysseus, looking forlornly at the horizon on a Greek ship, with the Dune soundtrack wailing in Dolby Atmos. Or Rebecca Ferguson as Calypso watching him leave. If that’s all I’d ever get, I’ll take it.",

    "text": " Happy Easter everyone. I’m here to bring up a Christian inspired fantasy film series and discuss why it failed. Probably because of the “ fantasy” trend of the 2000s, and to replicate Harry Potter and LOTRs success Disney bought the rights to all of CS Lewis’ Narnia series. And sure enough, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was a box office success, if not a smash. The Nostalgia critic very wittily compared it to “ Mary Poppins” meets “ the Two Towers.” Disney also made “ Prince Caspian” and “ Voyage of the Dawn Treader” both of which had “ meh” success and no new series were adapted. Part of the problem is, most of the books are kind of dull and not “ action packed.” TLTWATW is far and away the most Famous of the stories, because it’s the best written and most memorable. They aren’t very adaptable to the big screen and are sort of like quiet theology lessons wrapped in an very tame fantasy setting. Unlike LOTR, Narnia had pretty ham fisted Christian allegory. Nothing necessarily box office killing about it, but audiences don’t like being hit over the head. LOTR is filled with Catholic symbolism, but it’s hidden, woven enough so it isn’t obvious to people who don’t come from that traction and doesn’t get in the way of the main story. Apart from TLTWATW, Narnia books can be a bit dull and unmemorable. Maybe Disney’s CEO glanced at the remaining books and thought “ better quit while I’m ahead.” Thoughts?",

My point of view as an italian: We had been protagonists of many pieces of film history (Sergio Leone, Federico Fellini, Alberto Sordi, the neorealism) but now our producers are lazy and we don't have anymore an industry that focuses on genre films. We produce mainly sad comedies, copies of copies of copies of the original Italian comedy style. Then we make a lot of movies full of social issues but with little substance, no pathos and no interesting stylistic choices. In the midst of all this only a few directors stand out: Muccino, Sorrentino, Mainetti, Sibilia. Gabriele Mainetti made two genre films that talk about superheroes in an all-italian way but with an absolutely international style. I hope it can set an example for producers so that more genre films are produced, to give italian cinema the importance and quality it could have.",

      "Filmmaking don't have borders but the industry yes. My point of view as an italian: We had been protagonists of many pieces of film history (Sergio Leone, Federico Fellini, Alberto Sordi, the neorealism) but now our producers are lazy and we don't have anymore an industry that focuses on genre films.",
      "Sergio Leone and Pier Paolo Pasolini are of course also geniuses of cinema. Mario and Lamberto Bava... Sergio Martino... Michele Soavi... Ruggero Deodato.",
      "We produce mainly sad comedies, copies of copies of copies of the original Italian comedy style.",
      "The Great Beauty was the only Italian film from recent decades to make my yearly top tens. France has had a bunch so your directors are definitely under achieving.",
      "That was a film that really stood out! Then we make a lot of movies full of social issues but with little substance, no pathos and no interesting stylistic choices.",
      "Sorrentino is okay, but I feel like he doesn’t have as much substance as he thinks he does and wears his influences heavily on his sleeves. What do you think of Alice Rohrwacher and Pietro Marcello? I necessarily haven’t been blown away from Rohrwacher yet, but I find her quite interesting.",
      "Young Pope was also very good. In the midst of all this only a few directors stand out: Muccino, Sorrentino, Mainetti, Sibilia.",
      "oh i do want to add that antonioni should be included in the list of great italian directors alongside fellini. mario bava is also a personal fave."

    "text": " an adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel and likely the biggest budgeted and most high profile. Probably the most notable thing about Phantoms is that it stars a young Ben Affleck in what is probably his first leading role and what is basically a footnote in his career. We also have actors like Liev Schreiber and Rose McGowan who were fresh off Scream and the late great Peter O'Toole who instantly brings a sense of class and credibility to the movie. The concept of this film is honestly great blending haunted house type horror with creature feature type stuff that will remind of films like Carpenter's The Thing and The Blob remake and the first 40 minutes are actually solidly eerie, mysterious, and suspenseful. Unfortunately the film quickly goes downhill once we find out the true nature of the antagonist and then devolved into mumbo jumbo about petroleum jelly and a genuinely terrible climax. Too bad. Maybe don't hire the director of Halloween 6 to make a movie with such a great concept. Not as bad as the critical reviews and an all right enough time waster but probably a prime example of a film that should be remade. Also, yes Affleck was da bomb in this movie",

A horror film with Ben Affleck in what is likely his first leading role, Rose McGowan, Liev Scheiber and the late great Peter O’Toole is a prime example of a film that starts solidly but falls apart by the end. an adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel and likely the biggest budgeted and most high profile.. Probably the most notable thing about Phantoms is that it stars a young Ben Affleck in what is probably his first leading role and what is basically a footnote in his career.",

Looking back now it seems silly, but to be around in the early stages of the internet and the word of mouth promotion of this movie, it was a crazy experience I remember my friends and I not knowing if this was real or not, and it was hard to get information about the movie at the time. I really love the story of the movie, and I think that the actors did a good job of acting like three people lost in the woods with no hope of survival.

Then there's the last exorcism which really throws a twist on found footage, but also exorcism tropes.",
      "Back in 1999 before YouTube was started and in the VERY early stages of Google, the hype about this film felt real.",
      "maybe that's because there's been more found footage films over time that have denser storylines. blair witch project was a bit slow for most of it, but the intense parts were incredible.",
      "It was an original. Looking back now it seems silly, but to be around in the early stages of the internet and the word of mouth promotion of this movie, it was a crazy experience I remember my friends and I not knowing if this was real or not, and it was hard to get information about the movie at the time.",
      "Willow Creek and Lake Mungo are worth a watch if you’re into Blair Witch. Those two films are leagues ahead of Paranormal Activity and have a lot of fun with the sub genre. Lake Mungo is Australian and seems to be pretty slept-on.",
      "I really love the story of the movie, and I think that the actors did a good job of acting like three people lost in the woods with no hope of survival.. The Blair Witch Project is the gold standard of found footage movies, and it’s so cool",
      "It's a found footage film and was better (imho) than Blair Witch."

Maybe it’s because they posit that the spirit of the movies are more important than the letter of their exact details.

      "We're used to looking at attractive people in our stories. Most people are so fucking dumb if Blunt had boogers in her nose it would be too big a distraction for some and that would be their takeaway. I loved Quiet Place 2, but holy shit did you see Blunt's boogers?!",
      "You know what? Here we are, a year+ into the apocalypse",
      "What's crazy about Emily Blunt's beauty is that she spent the year before production as a true method actor, living like a hermit off the land in the wilds of Alaska...no electricity, no food but what she could hunt, no shelter save what she could build, no clothes but what she could sew. Twelve months later she walked onto the set and this is what you get.",
      "and she has perfect skin, perfect eyebrows, great hair....like she looks more like she's been camping out for a day or two rather than barely surviving and fighting for her life for the past year.",
      "WHile you are right, Blunt looks more like she's been camping out for a day or two rather than barely surviving and fighting. At least she isnt glammed up.",

In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous.

As it's said in Spiderman, \"with great power comes great responsibility;\" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it.",

Jared Leto was horrible as Morbius, the action, pacing, and editing are all terrible, and the story was so bland. Also bringing MCU Vulture into the Sony verse and not only retconing his character development from Homecoming but also completely contradicting the Spell from NWH is really dumb/stupid.",

Elizabeth should have had more screen time via flashbacks and I think it could have done with more engineer interaction before they were wiped out. The more classic alien should have also not been cgi when on the ship, I felt having it be someone in a practical suit as done in the original would have heightened the horror. Could have also slowed the pace of this part of the movie as when we realise an alien is on board within a few minutes it’s already shot out into space, could have done with another 10 minutes of trying to find it on the ship.

      "Also, Netflix’s compression favours faces and foreground objects, at the expense of backgrounds. When you’re watching, you’re not likely to notice that because you’re focused on the actor and they look sharp and detailed, but if you look closely at the background you’ll notice more softness. This actually extends to their production pipeline, too.",
      "Netflix also occasionally flops, too. Mitchells vs. The Machines, for example, had a ton of fine detail all over the whole frame, and Netflix’s compression often can’t keep up, resulting in straight up pixelation and other artifacts."

    "text": " By far, the most immersive and tightly-written of the Universal Monsters catalog. The set design and the pacing is what makes this movie tick, and I think the classic and comical characters help a lot with establishing the tone. The camera work in the underwater scenes are absolute perfection, it’s captured beautifully and I can totally understand how groundbreaking this became. It’s super cool to see a monstrous character become smart and adapt in his surroundings throughout the runtime. My only complaint really is just the character of Kay, she made questionable choices and she slowly became the typical damsel-in-distress character. But overall, this is a fascinating watch. What do you guys think of this classic?",

Needless to say, that added to my fondness for this cool movie.",
      "I personally thought this was the weakest of all the original monster movies - to the point of being a slog to get through (The tightest however being the Invisible Man). The creature looked good, and the underwater shots hold up, but beyond that nothing much that makes me want to revisit it.",
      "The opening Marineland scenes are deeply nostalgic for me as I often visited there during the same time frame and they have that mid-century modern bounce of scientific optimism. Even when it slows down a bit and taxes patience some in the final third, there's still the beautiful underwater scene when Kay is swimming in the spring, it's almost balletic. The whole film really holds up well, it's pretty much ne plus ultra B horror.",
      "Those underwater scenes are still amazing. I agree about Kay, but I do think the whole film kind of lost a step once the monster escapes. The Brazil opening is so good, it's like a little mini-film.",

The Raid 1, while violent, was also very straight forward and the violence was always used as a means of showing how far and extreme the situation the characters are in is digressing. It was a very carefully balanced film, where extreme violence would be used only to amplify the emotions of a certain moment. However, the sequel is a very confusing, muddled, unfocused, and overstuffed sequel that barely makes sense and constantly dials the violence up to an 11 for no reason other than \"violence and blood is cool\". It felt bizarre watching the sequel because it felt like a fanboys interpretation of what made The Raid 1 good, even though both movies were made by the same director! Strangely enough, The Raid 2 has a HIGHER imdb score and is generally considered to be BETTER than the first movie by a lot of fans. &x200B ; This got me thinking about other movies that have a \"Beloved Sequel\" but managed to garner a different audience for the sequel by missing what made the original so good. Another classic example would probably be Alien vs Aliens. One is a horror film while the other is an action movie. Both are good, but Aliens doesn't feel similar to the original. I might also argue that Toy Story 3 is a movie that a lot of people like, but it feels more like a love letter to the Toy Story franchise instead of feeling like an actual Toy Story movie. The first 2 movies were adventure movies but then the third movie is just... one really long prison break sequence? That's it? Where's the adventure? & x200B; What are your thoughts?",

So, if anything it is the first film that doesn't line up. Aliens didn't \"miss\" what made the first movie good, they went in a different direction on purpose.",
      "That's very interesting and actually makes a lot of sense. &x. ; This got me thinking about other movies that have a \"Beloved Sequel\" but managed to garner a different audience for the sequel by missing what made the original so good.",
      "Robocop 3 derailed the first 2 films by trying to be more family friendly...",
      "Another classic example would probably be Alien vs Aliens.",
      "Terminator and Terminator 2 are also a good comparison to the Alien vs. Aliens thing.",
      "One is a horror film while the other is an action movie.. Both are good, but Aliens doesn't feel similar to the original.",
      "Aliens probably fire the bill the best. Cameron purposely took it a different direction than the first movie.",
      "I might also argue that Toy Story 3 is a movie that a lot of people like, but it feels more like a love letter to the Toy Story franchise instead of feeling like an actual Toy Story movie.",
      "I disagree with Toy Story 3. While it isn't as good as the one it's still incredibly good and in my opinion a 10/10 movie.",
      "Haha everything you said is why I don't like HTTYD 3. The first 2 movies were adventure movies but then the third movie is just... one really long prison break sequence?",
      "Aliens is an example where the filmmaker understood what made the first film tick and pointedly went out of his way to not just regurgitate that same formula, that that tonal/genre difference between the two films is entirely intentional amuck to the benefit of that franchise, to boot). Ironically, that same filmmaker fucked things up with a sequel to his own film.",
      "There are so many poignant lines that support this narrative."

Grey herself said she couldn't get work after DD and the odd thing was that, JG had it better before DD than after, because before DD, she was more active. My theory is that maybe she wasn't that good of an actress. I re-watched DD and Grey's acting has not aged well and also, she was known for playing teens and by DD, she was pushing 30.",

The movie also influences other major sci-fi franchises like Starcraft and Warhammer 40k. But after Alien Resurrection, there has been a lack of action flicks involving space marines. Aliens vs Predators, bizarrely, decides to take place on Earth in the 21st century where humanity doesn't have the weapons to effectively kill other species, and thus, was entirely these two aliens fighting each other and humans were just fodders. AVP Requiem is a worse version of Freddy vs Jason. Promethium and Alien Covenant also feature a distinct lack of actions compared to Aliens despite its futuristic techs. I really wish they would just adapt the video game into a movie, have it take place in the future, and present a brutal all-out war between marines, Aliens, and Predators.

    "text": " If you asked anyone who the main protagonist of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies is, most people would say Jack Sparrow. However, if you asked them that same question between 2003 and 2006, I think you'd get a different answer. To me, the main protagonist of The Curse of the Black Pearl is undoubtedly Will Turner. It is his motivations (to save the love of his life, Elizabeth Swann) that drive the plot forward. It's a classic \"save the damsel in distress\" story structure. The damsel is not the main character, nor is the goofy sidekick who helps along the way. It's the lad doing the saving. Some may say that the Pirates movies are ensemble movies, with each of the protagonists getting a similar amount of screen time and priority, but that's only true of the films that followed. The original Pirates film is as much an ensemble as A New Hope is. It doesn't matter if Han Solo is the most popular character, Luke is clearly the main protagonist. People's opinion on the protagonist of this film has undoubtedly been marred by the subsequent films. There was a concerted effort to put Jack Sparrow, the most popular character, closer to center stage with each successive film. In the second and third films, they could at best be called an ensemble, if not just making Jack the protagonist outright. They proceeded to make two additional films that could be classified as \"Jack Sparrow solo films\". It's understandable that most people would associate the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise with Jack Sparrow, or consider him the main protagonist. But these people would be forgetting that, in the first film, Jack Sparrow was not the main protagonist. He was not the character that pushed the plot forward. He was a supporting character through and through. Some may argue that, with each successive film focusing more and more on Jack Sparrow, and with increasingly negative critical reception, the attempt to make Jack the protagonist is the reason for this decline. I'm not here to rule on that, as I quite enjoyed the rest of the trilogy, flawed as it is. I'm just here to clear the air over the perceived protagonist of the original film vs who the protagonist actually was.",

Had this been set/filmed in 2013 and definitely by 2014 Selfies, Instagram and Snapchat would be much more significant in the movie and altered it in someway. 2012 is also an interesting year for social media as Facebook was just already losing most of its crazy High School/College party photo site reputation and became more corporate and family focused, so it makes sense for it to not even be a factor for the characters, and Instagram wouldn’t become dominant until a year after. The movie came at a perfect time in 2012 and it would have been pretty different had it came out in 2010 (They would be carrying around Digital Cameras for Facebook) and definitely different in 2014 (they would be filming everything on iPhone 5’s for Instagram. 2012 seems like a perfect in between moment for the movie to work. but really beyond that everything about Spring Breakers is extremely 2012, from its entire casting to its Skrillex soundtrack. even the shock of Selena and Vanessa “going bad” in the movie wouldn’t have been as effective had it come out after Miley Cyrus’s real life ark eclipsed everything. also more straightforward the american Ring remake (2002) this movie came out in 2002 right near the end of VHS’s dominance, which works for the movie as a blank unmarked VHS is much more scary than a blank DVD, USB, or video file.",

Maybe it’s a much more obscure film that never lived up to it’s awesome premise due to budgetary restrictions.

These movies are usually not so dramatically extreme, they more often mostly take place in dimly lit offices and board rooms with professional journalists, lawyers, detectives and the like just finding solutions, creating strategy, debating, figuring out how best to make a good play. Do you have any great examples of these types of movies?",

Val Kilmer as Chris Knight was excellent in this movie, and this is my second favorite Val Kilmer performance behind Doc Holiday in Tombstone. He gives of an effortless vibe throughout the whole film, and it actually looks like this is what Val Kilmer is like in real life. The rest of the cast did an amazing job with their characters, and Lazlo (AKA Uncle Rico) is such a funny and cool character. The story is super fun and well written, and I liked the idea of it centering around college kids trying to build a laser. This is typical 80’s right here If you haven’t seen Real Genius, or if it’s been a long time since you have watched it, I would recommend watching it agin because it’s a funny movie that holds up well today!",

    "text": " It seemed like Die Hard With a Vengeance really set up the team dynamic well, you have the A plot with McClane and Zeus, the B plot with the Detectives and the school and the C plot with Simon and his gang. But each of the detectives had a distinct personality, the no-non sense boss, the take-no-shit woman detective, the Indian detective who gives John McClane alot of shit but respects him, his buddy who died, the eccentric bomb squad guy, it was like they had a more fleshed out role than in previous installments. And while other Die Hard movies usually they'd be reluctant in even helping or indulging McClane's suspicions, here they're in it with him from the opening credits onward. It kind of reminded me of recent Mission: Impossible films where Tom Cruise has the established team helping him take down the bad guys but also raising the stakes by getting the audience to like them. I wonder if Die Hard had followed that format and kept the team would it have been more successful in later installments?",

Not only is he hilarious, but he is an incredible actor who doesn’t let the comedy upstage the entire performance (something that ruins a movie with the fact that comedy is subjective). Often times you see drama actors struggle with comedic roles (Mark Wahlberg comes to mind), but I think comedy is much harder and with the performances I’ve seen from John C Reilly, he could act in anything.",
