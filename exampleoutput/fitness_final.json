    "title:": "M/28/5’8” - 8 month cut progress: 180-150 (Jan 2020 - Aug 2020)",
    "text": " Hey everyone. I finally hit my goal weight today and wanted to share. I went from 180 pounds to 150 pounds over the course of 8 months(Jan 2020 - Aug 2020) and a lot of this was while the gyms were closed so hopefully, this can serve as some motivation for you if you’re still stuck at home or maybe don’t want to go back to the gym yet. Quick background: I started lifting weights about 3 years ago. I would be pretty consistent for a couple of months and then fall off. Last year (Jan 2019) I kicked it into high gear and haven’t looked back. I was always skinny, and fell into the “perma bulk” stage, this just got me fat, so I decided to do a cut even though I was nervous about getting skinny again. The diet: I originally used the TDEE calculators you can find on the internet. To be honest, they weren’t accurate at all for me. I don’t know what they mean by “light exercise” “moderate exercise” etc, so I decided to take a liberal approach and originally I set my calories to 1600. I figured at most this was a 1000 calorie deficit. This was good for a while and I quickly started shaving off weight. But then the gyms closed, so I decided to up my calories to 1800 since I wasn’t getting the same kind of stimulus with bodyweight training that I was with heavy resistance training and I’d rather retain as much muscle as I could. This seemed to work in my favor(if anything I think I actually gained muscle, I’ll get into that later). During June I took a few weeks where I ate at maintenance(seems to be about 22-2300 for me) just for mental well being, but then I got right back on. I kept protein to around .8-1 gram per pound of bodyweight, fat at around 30-50 grams and filled the rest with carbs. I try to get most of my food from clean sources but I’m not gonna get into that too much. Just hit your protein and calories and you’ll be fine. You’re not going to be able to do that eating candy and ice cream so obviously you’re going to have to eat fairly clean. The training: My gym has been open since June, so from June to now, and originally January-March I’ve been sticking to a 3 day full body routine. It’s seemed to work really well for me. While the gyms were closed, I was lucky enough to have snagged one of those door frame pull up bars. I was just cranking out a ton of pull ups, push ups, squats and leg raises. Side note, don’t let anyone tell you bodyweight training can’t get you jacked. You won’t look like an IFBB pro, but really who does anyways? The split looks like this A(heavy push)Bench 2-3 sets reverse pyramidWeighted dips 2-3x8Cable rows 4x10Leg extensions 4x15Face pulls 4x15Barbell curls B(heavy pull)Deadlifts 2-3 sets reverse pyramidWeighted pull ups 2-3x8Goblet squat 4x10Flys 4x15Leg curls 4x15Lateral raise machine C(heavy leg)Squats 2-3 sets reverse pyramidDB stiff leg deadlift 2-3x8Incline DB press 4x10Straight arm pulldown 4x15Tricep extensionsIncline DB curls &x200B; I do abs at the end each session. Hanging leg raises and decline sit ups are all I’m doing. Current numbers:Squat: 205x5Bench: 185x5Deadlift: 245x5(I know these aren’t great numbers. Whatever.) I’m hitting everything 3x per week in a variety of rep ranges and intensities and it seems to work well. I like having each day focus on strenh for only one “movement pattern”. For the big lifts I like working up to a heavy weight for about 5 reps, dropping the weight and doing about 8 reps and then if I feel like it, doing a burn out set. This is just what I prefer. Recovery: I’m adding this as a part of it because a lot of people talk about recovery but not a lot of people take it very seriously. I honestly think most of my progress before was so limited(see current lift numbers above) because I didn’t get enough sleep, I didn’t eat well, I wasn’t doing any kind of mobility work, hydrating well etc. I was kind of just going to the gym. I now aim for 7-8 hours a night, a gallon of water a day, and have been doing lots of stretching. I would now consider recovery JUST AS IMPORTANT as training and diet, if not even more so and needs to be accounted for at the same level as everything else. Moving forward I want to start incorporating deep tissue massage once a month. The cardio: I stuck to a lot of walking. I’d have bouts where I tried running or jumping rope, but taking my kids for a walk a few times a week just seemed to work best. I got to spend good time with them and get some light exercise in. Do whatever you like though, it doesn’t really matter. Just move. Some takeaways: 1. Recovery needs to be a priority or you will not get the results you’re looking for. Play around with what you need personally. You can’t really go wrong with 8hrs of sleep, a gallon of water/day and stretching. 2. If your gyms are still closed, DON’T NEGLECT BODYWEIGHT TRAINING. My lifts have stayed the same or gotten stronger with 30 pounds off. I’m going to go out on a whim and attribute this to sticking to some sort of training(also the pump from doing a ton of push ups and pull ups is insane). Don’t overthink it, try to hit a certain push up/pull up/split squat(or regular squat) amount of reps per week. I also think it helped with the cut because I wasn’t moving heavy weight. Just a different stimulus. If you have resistance bands or dumbbells even better. 3. You’re better off tracking your food and weighing yourself every day to find your TDEE than trusting some algorithm on the internet. Your maintenance calories are not “2,643” your body doesn’t work like that. If you set your calories and find you’re gaining, cut back. Losing too much, add some. Etc. 4. Do whatever cardio you like, but I do think it’s important to do. It’s not necessary for fat loss, it’s just good for you. Plus getting outside is nice. 5. If you have a lot of weight to lose, or even if you’re in the 15-20% BF range, I believe(and studies seem to support this) that you CAN gain muscle in a deficit. So don’t think it has to be bulk/cut bulk/cut cycles forever. Be smart and honest about it. If you’re fat, cut. If you’re really lean(below 10%), you could probably afford to bulk if you want to. 6. Tracking food is not necessary, but I think it’s the equivalent of training a body part 1x per week compared to 2x per week. It’s just going to get you better results. 7. The more data you have on yourself, the better. To spitball off the previous point, track your food, weigh yourself everyday in the morning, take progress pictures, film your lifts, etc. It’s only going to help you. 8. I ended up having to cut a lot more weight than i initially thought, which is probably my ignorance. I thought I could drop to 170 and be lean. Little did i know, it wasn’t until I hit 160 that I started seeing some definition, and the last few weeks where I started seeing much more ab definition. so just keep that in mind if you’re planning a cut. If you’re a little fluffy you’re going to have to go longer than you might think. What’s next: I can tell you right away I do not want to bulk but I also don’t want to get much lighter than 150. I’m still a high enough body fat that I think I can milk out plenty of gains just eating around maintenance and “recomping” so I’m going to be doing some research on that. I would guess I’m somewhere between 15-18% (i truly don’t know). I’d like to get a little leaner in my midsection but I want to grow a bit in other areas like my arms and back. I realize I’m not “big”, I am not what most people say they want to look like, but I am very happy and proud of what I’ve accomplished. Hopefully it motivates you and serves as an inspiration.",

    "title:": "Balancing progressive overload and joint + connective tissue health: Giving my joints a break for 2 weeks",
    "text": " Soooo I've recently restarted going to the gym after an extended rest period of about 4 years lol. I had to stop cause of wrist issues (wrist tendonitis + instability), even though that original period of weightlifting only lasted 3-4 months back when I was 17/18. But it's been less than 2 months, and my joint issues are back - this time, with my shoulder, elbow and left knee joining the list of joints who protest me going to the gym. This is very aggravating, because I've been using quite low weights (upwards of 15/20 reps to reach anything even approaching close to failure) for generally 3 sets. I am also fairly certain that my form is good. None of my joints hurt but they feel the strain, and I know that if I keep going, I'm just gonna make it worse. So, much to my chagrin, I'm gonna take a 2 week break - no gym, no bodyweight exercise, trying to limit stress on joints from keyboard typing. Hopefully this'll help. Then I'll start from scratch, on very low weight, as I did at the start of June, and work myself up again. Which kinda raises the question which this entire point was leading up to: If tendons + joints require such a loooong time to adjust to higher loads being placed on them, compared to muscles, which adjust quite quickly, how do you carry out progressive overload safely? In particular for beginner lifters, who's loads are going to increase enormously in a relatively short period of time. Any advice/insight would be welcome!",

My max bench is 135 pounds currently, which is only up from 125 when I started. Also, I started benching 3 sets of 10 (95 pounds) and still cant do more sets than that, and cant even do a set of 10 of 115 pounds. I feel like I'm progressing way slower than I should be, so am i? What can I do to improve? (I do warm up and stretch before I bench, as well as drinking water. I also work out 5 days a week total, giving myself rest on weekends) Thanks a bunch.",

      "Your bench is over 90% of your body weight, which is pretty good for a new lifter. Bench will not progress as fast as squat or deadlift, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If anything you are progressing as expected for someone your size and experience, want to progress faster get on a program and eat something.",
      "If you're trying to get as strong as you can at bench, you need a spotter or to bench in the squat rack with the safest bars. Your bench practically won't progress if you're benching higher reps... Every week or so, try for singles, doubles, or triples.",
      "Just reading your answers, outside of eating more I'd suggest changing your rep scheme for bench. Instead of sets of 10, try increasing the weight and doing less reps - say, 6 or even 3. If you can bench something for 10 you're well beyond using that weight to challenge your body (in my non expert opinion).",
      "You aren't progressively overloading, so your progress seems pretty normal. You can't just stick with benching 10 of the same weight every day and expect to see improvements. If you're going for strenh you need to incrementally increase the weight, and lower the reps.",
      "That's pretty great, you're gonna build alot of muscle this way but if you start working down in reps and up in weight you'll start to train your body to be able to bench sets of 8, 5, 3, down to singles. You'll condition that muscle to be able to move the weight. I think the longer you train in high rep sets you're gonna build yourself a bigger base, with more muscle you can condition for strenh.",
      "Try doing 3 starting off with 115, 2 times a week, and every bench day, add 5 lbs. When you eventually fail, switch it to 2, and when you fail again, switch to 1. Restart at a higher weight for 3 again."

    "text": " At the end of my Freshman year of high school, I weighed in at nearly 190-200 lbs and hated how I looked. That summer, I decided to lose some weight, and got all the way down to 130 lbs Unfortunately, in my sophomore year, I had developed anorexia and an even more severe body dysmorphia problem. In my Junior year, I started lifting weights and was slowly able to overcome my terrible relationship with food, gaining a decent amount of muscle but also a decent amount of fat. Today, I am a Senior, and am finally coming to love the way I look. I have an amazing relationship with food, love to workout, and am starting to like the way I look So please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask about my journey! More specific information: Starting weight: 190-200 lbs Starting Height: 5’7 Age: 15 Current Weight: 155 lbs Current Height: 5’7 Current Age: 18 Workout program: I played a lot of sports during 9-10th grade, but in 11th I started lifting everyday. I alternated between the PPLx2 program and Layne Norton’s PHAT. Mostly PPLx2 though. Diet: I basically ate all clean foods, aka “bro foods.” I counted out my calories/macros to a T, and still continue to do that. When I wanted to lose weight, I was in a caloric deficit, and when I wanted to gain, I upped the calories and whatnot. You may notice that I don’t look very lean in the picture on the right, and that is partly due to me have a little fat left, but also a fair amount of loose skin. Can’t tell in the picture, but I can actually pull it out quite a bit. Covers all of my abs, unfortunately. Haha",

    "text": " I'm a 20 year old male and I weigh 305.8 pounds. Three weeks ago I got sick of being disgusting and started doing a ketogenic diet. I lost 17 pounds in the first 17 days (haven't weighed myself since). I did this mainly by dieting, but started couch to 5k (c25k) a week ago. I'm not doing that to lose weight; I'm doing it to begin training for a 5-day hike me and my friends are doing in August. I'm doing that three days/week and I really want to add resistance training to my regimen. I love free weights so I'd want to do something with that. I'm eating 1200 calories/day right now which is a 1500 calorie deficit. I want to start lifting but I'm not willing to change my diet. My diet has been going great, I love how much weight I'm losing and feel better than I have in years. With that in mind, what should I do for strenh training? Should I start a 5x5 regimen, continuing to eat at my deficit? Will that even do anything? Is it even possible to gain muscle when you're eating at a deficit that high? I'd love to build muscle during this transformation of mine, but I realize that it's probably unrealistic to expect to gain muscle whilst eating at a large deficit for such a long time (I'm expecting this to take a year, possibly longer. Because of that, I'd be happy to strenh train just so that I can prevent muscle loss and extra skin as much as possible. So what do you think fit tit, should I start lifting? If so, would stronglifts 5x5 be a good regimen to follow?",

    "text": " Thanks in advance to anyone able to give useful advice. My questions are more broad than the title but I'll try to be clear and concise. I'm looking to set myself up with a more effective fitness routine than I currently have, mainly focusing on core exercises and diet. I don't have much technical knowledge and basically have had the same old routine and been the same weight for ages. Current situation: 23, male, 173cm (5'8\"), 60.5kg (133lbs). are two found images that illustrate roughly what I currently look like (in flattering light), and what the goal is. My maintenance diet should be approx 2017 calories I think. Currently my diet is quite varied. I tend to just have coffee for breakfast, something like a sandwich, fruit and maybe some nuts for lunch, (or sometimes leftover dinner) and a broad range of things for my evening meal, but typically pretty balanced. I have no real idea if I'm around 2000kcal but I'm guessing so because my weight's quite consistent. I don't hugely want to get into a whole thing of counting calories or (heavily) restricting what I'm eating, as I don't have that much flexibility or even spare mental space to think about it. That being said, I can totally adapt my life to some general guidelines. When my life's under control I probably go to the gym three times a week, maybe four. Each time I spend about an hour. Routine is first, a 10 minute run, then: 3x30 press ups (or close to it) 3x10 hanging leg raises 3x10 chin ups (or close to it) 2x15 each side 15kg (33lbs) bentover row 2x10 15kg (33lbs) DB bench press 2x10 25kg (55lbs) barbell squat (with like a raise at the top...) 2x10 12.5kg (27.5lbs) DB curl into Arnold press Then one training session from the app Six Pack in 30 Days (ha!) which includes a range of ab exercises like crunches of various types, V-ups, planks, and leg raises. I generally don't find these too challenging except when I don't seem to be able to balance properly. I'm considering adding in/mixing in the 5/3/1 for beginners routine. What I'd like to know is how my current gym routine + diet can be improved to ensure I'm actually improving rather than maintaining, targeting my lower abs better, and not wasting my energy in counterproductive ways. Should I be bulking and then cutting? Lean bulking? Just cutting? Not running? Eating more? Any useful advice and tips are welcome. Genuine questions also. Or a point in the right direction. It's about 10 weeks until summer here and I'd love to have some kind of improvement by then. Thanks for reading.",

    "text": " The Realize the angle isn't the greatest to see the start (consequence of the new home gym: don't have much space) but you can see the load at the top of the rep, and this details the technique. BACKGROUND It's worth noting that this is my second time using a trap bar in like a decade. I set a PR of on this lift 6 days before. I'm using the Titan rackable trap bar, which, so far, has been an awesome product. I never cared for trap bars before, because ones you can find typically have very short loading handles and max out early. This one has plenty of room for growth, and is rugged. I'm around 195lbs at 5'9. My bodycomp is on the these days. I moved across the country earlier in the month, dropped some weight in doing so, and have been eating a bunch in an attempt to put some size back on. PROGRAMMING This lift in particular is part of my employment of a \"Maximal Effort\" approach to deadlifts. If you're unfamiliar with the Max Effort method, Dave Tate gives a great overview of it (along with the dynamic effort and repetition effort methods) That article is a great read in general. After hitting a topset on that movement, these days I employ a giant set (no rest between movements) of axle deficit deadlifts, reverse hyperextensions and squats (1 week front squats with a safety squat bar, 1 week buffalo bar squats), sets of 10 on each exercise. For the deficit deadlifts, I increase the height of the deficit each week for 3 weeks, then restart the cycle over with more weight after that. Everything else is standard progression. My squat day (which I feel contributes to this as well) is pretty unique. I rotate between 3 different squat exercises: front squats with a safety squat bar, buffalo bar squats, and safety squat bar squats. In addition, I rotate between 3 rep ranges: sets of 10, sets of 8, and sets of 6. With those 3 exercises, I double back to buffalo bar squats between rotations. By that, I mean that a rotation may look like this Week 1: Front squats for 10 Week 2: Buffalo bar squats for 8 Week 3: SSB squats for 6 Week 4: Buffalo bar squats for 10 Week 5: Front squats for 8 Week 6: Buffalo bar squats for 6 You get the picture. I keep the reps the same through all my warm-up sets. This is a ramping up approach, with the goal being to accumulate a great deal of fatigue before my topset of the day. I advance weight by 45lb plates on the buffalo bar and SSB squats, and 25s or 45s on the front squat. For example, let's say it was 8s week on buffalo bar squat, workout might look like this 8xBar 8x135 8x225 8x315 8x405 8x315 That final set is a backoff set that I'll do, using the weight done before the topset. Just gets in more volume. And on the topic of generating maximal fatigue, it should be noted that all of this is done as part of a giant set, with reverse hyperextensions and either box jumps, clean pulls, or stone of steel extensions. Basically squat, then do something explosive, then do the reverse hyperextensions. I think rest for 3 minutes and 45 seconds and start the whole thing over again. This has been showing solid results in my squat growth and carrying over well to all of my pullling. I also have a day for pressing and for benching, but aside from some ab wheel on the bench day and rear delt/back work on the press day, I don't feel either contributed to this PR, so not terribly worth discussing. --- Wanted to share with ya'll.

Any advice on how I can help him is always appreciated. &x200B; Update: Thank you everyone so much for taking the time and giving their feedback. I met up with this kid on Saturday we had a great workout, I used a lot of the ideas and points people have mentioned here to help him out.

Do not do HIIT or any form of high intensity workout since you do not know your recovery rate, you do not even know if your muscles are recovering enough to do same body part 2 times a week. Does any of this make any sense? I think he just is trying to sell his personal training to me and I really would like to know if the above factors mentioned by him matter at all.",

The thing is that in the military, especially where tough selections are concerned, you have to be able to do those workouts and then carry on with your daily work load. So it would definitely be better for you to take some shorter recoveries and otherwise stay moving in some capacity throughout the day.",

Okay to clear some things up, for anyone not aware, \"Lunk\" is the term that Planet Fitness uses for the type of person who goes to the gym in a stringer or tank top, lifts heavy weights, grunts, brings in a gallon jug, and judges other people. I use the word lunk to describe myself jokingly as I do all of those things, however I do not judge. I am not a huge dude, I am 5' 9\" 185lbs, and pretty lean. Big by Planet fitness standards and let me tell you I could feel the judgment the second I walked in. I was very polite, very understanding that I would not be looked upon to kindly of by some of the patrons, so I did my best to be overly polite and compliant, and as I always have, treat every stranger with the respect we all deserve. I get to the desk, \"sign here here and here yada yada yada\" and I begin working out. The colors are a little over the top, and dumbbells only go up to 75's but I could deal. Actually if anything it made it easier not to drop weights too hard(one of their big no no's). Let me tell you, the people there were very timid, a lot of them seemed low confidence, but none of them gave me even the slightest dirty look. A few guys started making conversation with me and to tell you the truth they were some of the most sincere people I've met at the gym. We jumped in with each other on machines, pushed eachother, and spotted each other. I left the gym everyday with less and less resentment towards the place. I get that it's not a bodybuilders gym, if anything it's the worst place for power lifters and BB. However I just wanted to share with ya'll that they are not as bad as they're made out to be. End of the day it is a corporate establishment and they can cater to whoever they want. However the one thing is sure about every gym and it's that they are filled with people from all walks of life just trying to be a better version of themselves. Sorry for the rant but its just something I wanted to share as most of the things I read about planet fitness are negative and usually bashing it. I too was guilty of the same thing for a long time.

      "I was very polite, very understanding that I would not be looked upon to kindly of by some of the patrons, so I did my best to be overly polite and compliant, and as I always have, treat every stranger with the respect we all deserve.",
      "PF was my stepping stone. I \"graduated\" from it after about 8 months where I moved on to LA Fitness for better free weights and more equipment options. Now I'm over at Gold's Gym trying to regain my physique after a 8 month hiatus and let me tell ya, it's not easy.",
      "I get to the desk, \"sign here here and here yada yada yada\" and I begin working out.",

      "I've been going to planet fitness for about 2 years, only had a few incidents where people were kind of acting like asses, otherwise everyone has been polite and talkative. We even have a few guys that go in that are far above my lifting abilities (they are huge, and can bench 5 caddies) and people sometimes even seek tips from them.",
      "Actually if anything it made it easier not to drop weights too hard(one of their big no no's).",
      "Planet Fitness is the first gym I've had a membership with, and I got into bodybuilding there. As long as you don't scream, and don't drop your weights on purpose, no one cares. I just wish that all of the super strict planets out there didn't get all of the bad press, but that seems to be all of what the media cares about.",
      "Let me tell you, the people there were very timid, a lot of them seemed low confidence, but none of them gave me even the slightest dirty look.",
      "I never saw any negative behavior towards anyone at my planet fitness... plenty of fit people, and some out of shape, all doing their thing and respecting each other."

    "text": " I'm a 35 year old father of four. I design for a living and lived a sedentary lifestyle up until about 6 months ago. I smoked, never played sports, overweight for the most part of my life, had severe sleep apnea, and was a former meth addict (college years. The habit forced me to drop out of an engineering degree on my 3rd year.) A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was taking a progressive dose of anti-depressants. The meds were supposed to make me feel somehow confident and uplifted- and was supposed to help me cope with my OCD as well. It made me feel OK at first but later on it made me feel empty and suicidal. After a while of taking it, I found myself no longer enjoying that things that I used to enjoy- like making art, designing merchandise, and cooking. I suspect these activities are somehow tied to my OCD. I spoke to my family doctor about it and she suggested that perhaps I should try natural means of defeating my mental illness such as exposure therapy and exercise. Due to my plantar fasciitis and joints, back, and knees problem- the only exercise that she would allow me to do was swimming. Thanks to my social anxiety- I abhor swimming. July 2015. My 15 yr old girl and 6 yr old boy joined a Muay Thai gym in our area. Driving them and picking them up from the gym became my exposure therapy of sorts. I like the vibe but was very hesitant because I always had the mindset that I was not made for sports. At the urging of my wife and kids (we live in a tiny apartment and, thanks to my severe apnea, they can't stand my snoring anymore) I decided to join them. My doctor was against it but I was born a rebel so I persevered and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sport. I have since lost more than 20 lbs and I continue to burn anywhere between 1-3 lbs per week. My relationship with my wife and family is now waaaay better and I no longer need my prescription. Being physically fit changed my life. Sorry I have to watermark it, I don't want to fall prey to those with mercenary motives who steal photos like this and use it for their own profit.",

Back in the day I used to be pretty jacked. Way back in the day. I have spent the last 7 years in an office and have not lifted a weight in probably 6 years. A few hours ago, I go into the gym. Headphones on. In the zone. Sore all over already. Today is leg day. First leg day in 6+ years. Trying to do 5x5 routine because I'm skinny fat. Warm up a bit on treadmill. Make my way to squat rack. Smile at cutie on the way by. She smiles back. \"I'm the man\" playin. Not sure what to go for. Back in the day, squatted like a beast. Momma didn't raise no dummy, load reasonable weight, use safety bar things. Notice cutie looking in the mirror. Load more weight. \"You got this\" Don't have it. Not at all. Bar comes off rack so hard. Legs straight buckle. Roll forward. Slam into wall. Deafening bang as bar slams down. Jump up like nothing happened. Gym is dead silent. People are watching. See Cutie blushing trying hard not to laugh. Stand around for a second. Try and lift bar back onto rack. Can't. Eventually unload plates, get setup again. Squat less than I did in HS. Huff and puff the whole time. Almost puke on 5th set. Don't make eye contact with anyone for the rest of the time. On another note, my dog is getting really good at fetch.",

We're doing our final set, and he loads two 25's on each side, 50lbs is huge to add to such an intense workout. He busts out 15 reps with such unreal intensity, by the 10th rep he had an insane pump going, and thats when the tears started breaking out and streaming down his face. He's grunting/yelling/making sounds (not too loud to disrupt the maybe...3 people in the gym at the time?) by the 10th rep. After the 15th he could barely get the bar up. When he was done he was a complete wreck. Very close to fainting, tears fully on streaming down his face. Red as a tomato, total rage, huffing and puffing. I asked him what was up, he replied in such a shaky/sobby voice: \"She took my kids, my money, my life.\" And then proceeded to the lockers to wash up and leave. Just a story I thought I'd share. His name is Robert. No his last name is not Paulson god damnit.",

    "title:": "5 months on keto and in gym: 430 to !",
    "text": " Hello All, Wanted to take some time out to share my experiences with /r/fitness since this sub has provided me so much useful information and inspiration. I have tried dieting more times in the past than i care to admit. I always lose some weight and then would yoyo back up to my starting weight or higher. I could never stick to a diet for more than about a month or so. I was a D1 football player years ago, so i knew how to lift, and how to train.... but i didnt know how to be healthy, and how to manage my nutrition. I had lifted off and on for the last 10 years or so since i quit playing, but i never got serious about being back in the gym. As i am writing this, my daughter is 3 years old and i also have a 2 year old son. To go along with my beautiful fiance and my two step sons at 6 and 8. I was always overweight, but in the last few years it was spiralling out of control. last summer and fall i found myself extremely unhappy with who i was becoming. I would literally bring sweat rags with me anywhere i went so i wouldnt soak through my collar... i was having trouble with simple tasks like tying my shoes, or playing any sort of athletic sport. I also was constantly too tired to play with my kids when i got home from work. I just chalked it up to being tired from a long day, but it was more than that. i have a desk job... i should not be this tired.... I desperately did not want to miss out on my kids childhood because i couldnt take care of myself. And i dont want to die and miss them growing up. And most importantly i dont want my poor lifestyle choices to hold them back.... i want them to be outside playing and having fun, and not stuck inside with tv because i wont go out to watch them. I started doing research in november to figure out what i was going to do. I wanted to take my time and formulate a plan that i could stick to once and for all. after several weeks of studying and thousands of hours and blogs researched, i decided i wanted to try the keto diet. I know the keto diet is controversial, but i had done my homework and i knew that the low calorie diets had failed for me in the past. I want to point out that i dont claim keto is the answer for everyone, and i never try to push it on people. I think that when it comes to diet, everyone is different, and its important to find hat works for you individually. Whether its iifym, paleo, vegan, low fat, low calorie, or keto. I think that the key is finding what works for you and having the resolve to stick to it. For me this has been KEto. the diet is basically high fat, moderate protein, and low carb. It isnt atkins.... because its high fat. the idea is that the higher fat consumption will help satiate and keep you from having cravings or binging. There is also alot of studies surrounding the medical benefits of a ketogenic diet. So once it was decided what diet i was going to do, all that was left was to start. I decided to start the Monday after Thanksgiving. November 28th, 2016. I gave myself the one last holiday to enjoy and then started. I considered waiting through the holiday season and starting the new year.... but i knew there would always be a reason to wait and something coming up... so i just started. I have always been competitive, and knew i would need results to stay motivated... and i would need aggressive goals to keep working towards. So i set a 3 month weight loss goal of 100 pounds lost... and a 6 month goal of 150 pounds lost. my 6 month date happens to fall on memorial day. On February 28th... my 3 month mark, i was down exactly 100 pounds. I hit the goal dead on. I was motivated to keep working. My training: at first i really only walked. i did long dedicated walks, but i also just walked whenever i could... whether it be taking smaller loads to the trash or smaller handful of groceries.... anything to get a few hundred more steps in. after a couple of weeks i started going to the gym.... boy was i out of shape. Most days i was lucky to last 30 minutes.... As the weight came off, my endurance began to grow... before i knew it i was starting C25K (around the 2 month mark)... and i was lifting for longer and longer in the gym. I had settled on a 4 day gym split doing a push/pull routine. I did light legs on my pull days to not wear my legs out so i could continue doing cardio in the evenings. At the 3 months mark i decided to up my protein and start getting more serious in the gym. I decided to switch my routine and i started with a modified Wendler 5/3/1 program. Basically i was just doing a couple accessory lifts every day in addition to the base program. I have now been doing this program for two months. As far as health goes... my life has changed dramatically... I was on 2 different blood pressure meds... cholesterol meds... and was pre diabetic. I am now off all of my meds and completely normal A1C.",

    "title:": "I filed for divorce in September and dedicated my 90 day waiting period to getting as big and strong as I could. Here are the results.",
    "text": " Background: I have always been in pretty good shape due to the various sports I played while growing up. Then in college the gym became my stress relief, the place I would go to get away from the stresses of work, finals, whatever. I made great friends there, and always enjoyed the various associations I made there. That was until I got married in September, 2015. I'd still go to the gym once or twice a week, mostly by myself and sometimes with my wife, but most, if not all of my healthy habits started to diminished very quickly. Over the course of 2016, my marriage started to crumble and became very toxic. I was the most unhealthy I had ever been in my entire life, in every category. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating right, I started to struggle at work, I was emotionally fragile, and spiritually shattered. It was obvious to everyone but me. I eventually came to see what was happening, and decided that enough was enough. I filed for divorce in September, and it was finalized on December 22. Plan I figured that since I had 90 days to basically wait in limbo while everything was processed by the courts, I would take this time and try and get as big and strong as I could, basically just to give me something to do and work towards. Here are the . I didn't do anything crazy, but followed the advanced part of almost to the letter. I'd never done a PPL routine before. I really liked it I didn't do a very good job of counting calories or macros.. But on an average day I'd eat around 3000 calories. Breakfast oatmeal and a banana Lunch was completely random each day, as I eat out most of the time... Dinner Almost everyday was 2 chicken breasts, 3 golden potatoes and a protein shake. Gains My starting weight was 180 and my weight at the time of the pictures was 193. My peak weight was 196.5. I've since been sick for about 2 weeks and have settled back to about 185.. I've never tried to do a bulk before, so I really didn't know what kind of results to expect, so I'm not sure if this is good or not, but I feel great I plan on getting more serious about the nutrition side of things as I go forward, because I know it's important. I wish I had done a better job of documenting my starting lifts.. Since I hadn't really lifted seriously for at least a year, I think that accounts for why I gained as much strenh as I did. I probably awakened a lot of the strenh I used to have too. I remember going into do flat bench and struggling to put up 185. Last week I did 3 reps of 265 Most I've ever done. The biggest gains by far were in my self esteem and confidence. Getting out of an unhealthy situation and putting myself into a healthy one. I am much more confident now. I smile more. I laugh. And I sleep better than I have in a long time. I'm happy with myself again. Don't ever settle. Especially if you're in a shitty situation. Thanks r/fitness for all your help",

    "text": " The only decent gym in my area charges $50 per month and it's always packed, so I figured i'd try building a gym for the price of roughly a one year membership ($600). Here's the rundown: Standard weights (220 lbs), dumbbells, ez bar and standard bar on CL - $100 Olympic weights (400 lbs), olympic bar and pair of 35 lb hex dumbbells on CL - $200 Floor mats - $80 Weight stand from play it again sports - $25 5 54x24 mirrors on CL - $40 Total - $815 I went a bit over my budget, but I might still end up selling some of those Olympic plates. I justified the extra I spent by telling myself I can always just sell most of this stuff on CL and still end up with a relatively minimal loss compared to what I originally bought the stuff for. For anyone thinking about doing something like this themselves, I can't recommend mirrors enough. Not only do they let you look at your magnificent self while you lift heavy things, but they're terrific at both adding more light to the room and helps you keep your form in check. If I had to do it all over again, I think the only thing I would do different is buying the heavy duty floor mats instead of the jigsaw ones. You can tell they're cheap and they seem like they're already breaking down a bit. I'm going to buy at least one to put underneath the Olympic bar i've got on the ground there. I'm also probably going to buy a pair of dip handles and something to tag onto the side of the cage to hold the rest of the weights i've got stacked in the corner, so I can use that space for stuff like curls and resistance band exercises.",

    "title:": "My top 12 tips for StrongLifts",
    "text": " Long time lurker here. I am by no means an expert (who is here, besides Phrak, really?) but having finished StrongLifts a couple weeks ago after roughly 11 months on it, I thought I could try to give back to the community, having leeched off of it for so long. This isn't gonna cover everything lifting-related. The and is for that. These are supplemental StrongLift (SL)-specific tips for people who are just starting SL and have researched the programme already. The has a wealth of information - read it. You don't even need to download the \"guide\". The first 5 tips are cues for each lift which I found helpful. Before you skip over them, realise that the lifts are the programme. Sure it's important to understand the programming and the rationale behind SL but there's no point in continuing with it if you couldn't care less about form. So on to the advices: 1. Learn to deadlift properly. Stand with bar over your mid-foot. Keep stance fairly narrow. Keep your head neutral. Bend knees until shins hit the bar. Shoulder-blades should be directly above bar. Hold the bar low in your hands, close to your fingers. Keep hips relatively high - this is NOT a squat Lift your chest but DON'T squeeze your shoulder blades. Get slack out of your arms. Pull and keep bar close to your body. Dig heels into ground. Think about pulling the bar back - NOT up. Do NOT lean back at top/roll your shoulder back. Pull quickly, even on warm-up sets. Lower weight back down relatively quickly. 2. Learn to OHP properly. Feet shoulder-width apart. Grip bar just wider than your shoulders. Hold bar close to your wrist (not close to your fingers). Keep wrist straight. Elbows in front of bar but NOT upper-arms parallel with the floor. Elbows should not exceed a 45 degree angle out from your body (i.e. do not flare elbows). Chest up and look forward - NOT up/down. Once the bar reaches forehead level, shift torso forward. Nicolas Cage the bar up. Squeeze dat ass at the top and lock everything. 3. Learn to squat properly. Note: this describes a low bar (aka powerlifting style) squat, which SL calls for. It is generally safer than a high bar squat and offers better leverage, allowing you to lift more. Tighten-upper back. Make sure the bar is evenly spaced across your back. Hands should be in line with forearms and NOT supporting the bar (i.e. keep thumbs over the bar). Lift chest up and forward and keep it there (don't let it fall). Keep shoulders back and down. Head neutral. Wide foot stance. Keep knees out Keep weight on HEELS and mid foot (curl toes if necessary to prevent putting weight on balls of feet). Always keep your back neutral or slightly curved (but NEVER rounded). At the bottom of your squat, drive up with your ass (Imagine a chain from the ceiling pulling lower back straight up). Try to raise chest at same time (i.e. do not turn the lift into a ). Squeeze dat ass at the top. 4. Learn to bench press properly. Note: 95% of the bros in my gym don't bench like this and I don't understand why. The trainers in my gym call it the \"powerlifting style\" bench but I can't see how any other style would be beneficial. Forearms perpendicular to the floor when bar touches your chest. Put the bar in your palm, close to your wrist (NOT close to fingers). Tight upper-back. Eyes directly under bar (when the bar is racked). Chest up and big arch in back, but keeping ass on bench. Weight should be on the traps. Feet as far back as possible. Knees should be lower than hips. Keep legs tight. Squeeze the bar (helped me a lot). Press in a straight line with elbows close to ribs (flaring is easier but will lead to injuries in the long-run). Imagine breaking bar in half towards your feet. 5. Learn to row properly. Row from the floor every time. Keep bar very close to legs before pulling. Grip the bar like you bench press (i.e. squeeze it). Pull with your elbows. Row against your chest. Keep upper back parallel with floor. Open your chest at top of movement (squeeze shoulder blades for a second). Keep your head down (take this time to look for cracks in the floor from all the weight you've been throwing around). 6. Don't add weight too quickly. The programme will seem easy at the start but the whole point is to perfect the form for each lift at a lower weight so you don't injure yourself at a higher one. Resist the temptation.",

    "title:": "Finally joined the 1, club last night at ",
    "text": " Last night I finally joined the 1,000lb club. I didn't really have anyone to share this with as most of my friends have stopped working out as they have settled down into family life, so I thought I would share my experience. I am currently 28 y/o male weighing 183lbs and just over 6' tall. I repped out 2 each of 425lb DL, 265lb BP, and 325lb squat last night. Most of my knowledge and mindset in the gym has come from playing division one football in college. I have also sprinkled in some HIIT ideas from \"Insanity.\" Two winters ago after mainly focusing on appearance rather than strenh I made a conscious decision to really involve my legs more in my workout. The change came after seeing a photo of myself wakeboarding in which my upper body was comically bigger than my skinny legs. I really concentrated on form for the first couple months, keeping my squat and deadlift weight around 135lbs. I would start every workout with 3-4 sets of around 10-15 reps, usually involving 4-5 day splits. I was rotating squats, deadlifts, step-ups with dumbbells, and the leg press machine at the start of every workout. As my career has taken off I have been forced to 2-3 day splits as such I have more recovery in between workouts, however less time in the gym. I still rotate those 4 leg exercises with a 2-3 day split at the beginning of every workout. Then I usually do a push-pull upper body consisting of chest/back, shoulders/traps, biceps/triceps. My chest has always been the weakest part of my body so I will favor chest days. This winter I stumbled upon Brandon Campbell's YouTube videos. This inspired me to really concentrate on building strenh rather than just appearance. His form and breathing techniques are what contributed most to my gains. I highly suggest watching his deadlift and squat \"What works for me\" videos. The main change after watching these videos was going from 10 rep sets to 2-3 rep sets. This allowed my to really increase weight on all my leg exercises. If I failed before 3 reps I would take off 10 lbs and always finish. For example if I was squatting 315 and could only do 2 I would go down to 305 and rep out 1 more. This was more of a mental thing for me as in my head I felt I \"completed\" that set. In terms of diet I haven't changed much for the last two years. I don't have a strict \"meal plan.\" Every weekday morning I start with two scoops of Athlete's Food meal replacement, along with two heaping tablespoons of non-fat yogurt, and almond milk. Lunch consists of a wrap or if my company cafeteria is serving fish I choose that option. After work I drink 1 scoop of AF and 1 scoop of Optimum Nutrition whey protein with 2 tablespoons of yogurt and almond milk again. After my workout I eat either fish or chicken with either steamed broccoli or boil-in-a-bag brown rice and black beans. Before bed I drink 2 scoops of ON whey protein again with the yogurt and almond milk. On weekends I eat pretty much whatever I want. (I must mention that I have always favored healthy foods, for example I've never liked sweets, chocolate, fried food, etc.) My snacks usually consist of fruits, nuts, or hummus. In the winter I am more lax and allow myself to cheat more often, in the summer I am much more strict and completely cut out cheese (except for cottage cheese). I would be happy to answer any more questions if anyone is interested. Thanks for reading.",

    "text": " So, I just ended Barbell Medicine's conditioning program and I got curious into what is conditioning. I found out after a few days of research that conditioning is extremely important for any kind of athlete since it builds work capacity, basically how much work can you do. The more work can you do, the higher intensity, frequency and volume you can have. Also it will impact directly your recovery which, again, means more possible work. Awesome, right? By digging deeper and deeper I found out that it also increase Lactate Threshold, builds Oxygen Capacity, increases VO₂ MAX which is important since this increase: maximum oxygen uptake in all muscle fibers capillaries to all muscle fiber types ability to slow the build-up of waste products (not just lactic acid) that will slow down your performance and, also, last but not least cardiovascular health. Now, this all is amazing, and we get to my question(s) here: 1. Why conditioning is not more pushed between athletes? 2. How much can you really improve your genetic set point on VO₂ MAX, work capacity et cetera? 3. Why VO₂ MAX and other factors are still considered controversial in terms of health indication? By looking at some metas, especially since everything I found before 4. Also by looking at most papers, research is mostly done on youth and the impact of aerobic and anaerobic training in early age. Why is that? Is it possible to close the gap in adults too and reach an incrementation of work capacity, lactate threshold et cetera like the gap between strenght-speed and speed-strenght? Thanks!",

There are times when - I'm not even kidding - there are times when I\"m in the middle of a work out, and actually woke up because i am so engrained with going to the gym and being there - it's that much of a habit to me.

    "text": " Hi everybody, Antranik here. I created these two videos recently to improve upon the and I'm sharing them here as well. The link is in the header and the summary is below them. 1. There are two phases of a pullup: The scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup. This can be done in one fluid motion but if you take a video of yourself and find your shoulders remain shrugged up or if you can barely get the chin-over, you should consciously focus on improving your scapular pull. Also, make sure you're going down ALL THE WAY and NOT doing half-ROM pullups which are super common. Another tip is to keep your feet uncrossed, thighs together and in front of you as it will make you stronger. 2. In part two, I demonstrate how to perform negative pullups properly, emphasizing the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight. Your goal is to do 10-second negatives. If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps (\"3x8\") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression. If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on . I hope that helps Please feel free to ask questions and leave feedback",

I have no expectation of becoming a pro runner. I'd just like to be able to jog at a steady pace for, say, a couple of kilometres, without dying. Is it best to jog along slowly with short strides, or is it better to use the full lenh of your legs and deliberately take larger strides?

By focusing on CICO, eating healthy, and going to the gym 3-5 times a week I was able to drop 77 lbs. At my heaviest back in January of last year I was 232 lbs, 5’9”and 36 yrs old, I mildly watched my diet the first 4 months and dropped maybe 15 lbs. In may I really started to think about health and that’s when I started CICO, at first I was running off about 1200 calories but that was just too little so I brought it up to 1500 and every 4 weeks I would have a week around 18-1900. I also started at a gym back in may, at first it was my local city rec center just to get comfortable and figure out what this working out thing was. Shortly after I joined another gym in town and started a basic ppl program. Since then I left that gym and joined a new one just due to my work schedule and it allows me to use multiple locations in multiple cities so when I’m away I don’t have a excuse to skip. Currently I am doing a 5/3/1 but really want to dial in my program as I am still kind of all over the place. Most of my lifts aren’t to good yet so I’ll skip them until I get better results but all I can say is I did get to 3 plates on a deadlift this week for 2 ugly reps Up next I’m going to now start upping my calories up to about 25-2600 and Work on muscle growth. Goal is to increase another 10lbs of muscle by January 2019 by bulking and cutting and stay around the 10-12% BF. Upping the clean eating is probably going to be the hard part as even now on my 1900 weeks it feels that I was having to really focus at getting higher healthy calories in. Think I will just add slightly bigger portions and 1-2 extra meals per day. I generally always meal prep and make a dz meals of 4-5oz of lean protein and rice and a form of veg that make up a 400-450 calorie meal and will go from 2 to 4 of those per day.

    "text": " Hi all, Curious about what others think about dipping to 90 degrees or all the way down on stationary weighted dips. I dipped with 90+lbs attached to my armpits without problem. Guess I had the shoulder mobility. I also felt the full ROM would help prepare me for strict Muscle Ups. Al Kavadlo seems to dip to his armpits on parallel bar dips . However, he probably does not load weight since he is a bodyweight purist. I know on ring dips gymnasts utilize the full ROM. But maybe my weighted dip will improve if I go just to 90 degrees instead of ATG like my weighted squat. On a related note, I have been trying to go ATG on weighted squats for years. Couldn't go past 250lbs with my 6' 2\" frame. Went to just 90 degrees and was (obviously) able to increase to 315lbs on the first go. Less lower back pain too. However, I know folks that would argue ATG on squats is the way to go. Maybe for pistols. But on weighted squats I could never get rid of the butt wink sufficiently. Always lower back soreness eventually on ATG weighted squats. Thoughts?",

    "text": " I'm a 31 year old female who last september finally got fed up with the way I was treating my body and my health, both mental and physical. I decided that it was time for some drastic life changes, so I joined a gym and started counting calories. Before and after: Face before and after: Some details: I started going to the gym three times per week, doing upper body one day, legs another and mostly cardio the third. I tried to go on hour long walks two times per week aswell in addition to the gym, just to get used to moving around. At the beginning I started small. Lifting light and just focusing on the basic muscle groups, with help from my dear friend the internet. When 3-4 weeks had passed I added some weight and just kept at it like that. On the days I did upper body I would mostly use barbells for every muscle group, doing 10 reps in three sets each. Leg day I mostly used machines, the same amount of reps and sets. When I was doing cardio I started with 30 mins on the treadmill, 5.5km/h with a slight slant and then 15 mins on the eliptical. Nothing fancy, just something to get my heartrate up. After a while I upped my game to 6km/h and 20 mins on the eliptical and after about four months I did HIIT (high intensity interval training) for 15 mins at the end of every gym session. That really did wonders for my stamina and metabolism I usually did HIIT on the eliptical, starting with 20 sec active, 20 sec rest and then cut the resting time to 15 and then 10. When summer came along I started cheating, skipping gym sessions and started falling back to my old habits so in august this year I signed up for sessions with a personal trainer and dietist, just to get things moving again. In this program I did a VLCD diet the first four weeks. I lost about 20lbs. On mondays and wednesdays I do circuit with my PT and on fridays and saturdays I do my own circuit and cardio. In between that I also walk/jog and do pilates at home. My week now: Monday: Circuit with my PT. It varies greatly but it focuses mostly on strenh and getting your heartrate way up. Tuesday: Walk/jog 60mins Wednesday: Circuit with my trainer Thursday: Pilates at home 50mins and Tabata 10mins as warm up. Friday: Upper body circuit and HIIT Saturday: Legs and abs circuit and HIIT Sunday: Rest Diet: I started using myfitnesspal, set my calorie goal at 1800 and made sure that my macros where okey everyday. My macro goals were 40% protein, 25% carbs, 35% fat. I cut out sugar, white bread and white pasta from my diet and only splurged on \"bad food\" on special occasions. I kept my portions small and never took seconds. I ate three meals a day to begin with, now I eat five. Normal day at the beginning: Breakfast: High protein, non sugar, low fat yoghurt with blueberries and a hardboiled egg. Coffe with non fat milk Lunch: Waterbased salad, some high fiber vegetables and chicken/fish Dinner: waterbased salad, high fiber vegetables, potatoes/brown rice etc. And some meat product. Normal day now: Breakfast example: hard bread, low fat cream cheese, low fat ham, bell pepper, cucumber and two eggs Lunch example: tuna salad with beans and eggs Dinner example: low fat ground beef, tzatziki, oven baked potatoes and veggies, waterbased salad on the side Snacks: carrots, apples, high protein yoghurt, berries etc two times a day. I base my meals on the following model: One hand waterbased veggies One fist of high fiber carbs/veggies One fist of protein One thumb of fat On saturdays I get to eat what I want. Often it's going out to a restaurant, or party or something like that. It works great if you can go back to normal the next day. I also do guided meditation three times per week, to help with stress and focusing on my goals. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you have any questions feel free to ask",

    "title:": "11 months of lifting. Did calisthenics, bulked, did weightlifting, and now I'm cutting.",
    "text": " Almost coming up on my year mark and wanted to share with you guys my progress so far and what I learned. Starting: My initial weight was 150lbs and height is 6'2 (189cm). I had tried lifting in college my sophomore and junior years but knew nothing at the time about diet or technique. I ended up injuring my back trying to lift WAY too heavy and stopped altogether. My diet was horrible, and I did not exercise at all the next two years and pretty much ate everything and anything I wanted. I started to get chronic lower back pains and initially blamed my height for it. A year later and it was still a problem (even after stretching, doctors and chiropractor visits). I decided to start working out again to strenhen my lower back and to improve my overall physique. Start of Calisthenics (5 months) I started off doing calisthenics only. My work had an outside 'jungle gym' so I used this as my main workout area. My workout consisted of mainly pull-ups, pushups, dips, and squats and was broken into a 4 day workout split. I did different variations of these main exercises with high intensity and very low rest time (30-45 seconds max). I usually did them circuit style and my workouts only lasted for 30 minutes (I did about 4-5 sets). But since it was such high intensity, my body/muscles grew a lot. I also coupled this with a high caloric diet (4000) and almost no cardio. I wanted to gain a lot of weight so I tried to retain as much calories as possible during my bulk. Weightlifting After my bulk, I managed to gain about 35lbs of muscle and fat (mostly fat) and weighed around 185lbs. It felt great knowing that I could actually put on weight I made pretty decent gains with calisthenics, mostly because my weight kept increasing as well as the number of sets and reps I did. But after awhile I felt I needed a changed and started lifting weights. My lifts are still centered around pullups, dips, pushups, and squats, except that I add weight to them (I started doing bench press and deadlifts as well). Diet I've cut back significantly on my calorie intake and now only eat around 2500 a day. I've also added back cardio into my workouts and run/sprint about 2-3 times a week. Supplements When I was bulking, I took creatine and protein powder. But as of know, I only take creatine. I feel my diet is solid enough to provide me enough protein for the day. Sleep and Workout Schedule I usually workout in the morning around 5:30am everyday because work takes up most of my day (9am-5pm), and I still wanted to have time to spend with my girlfriend (5pm - whenever she decides). I still got about 7-8 hours of sleep by sleeping around 10pm or 11pm. I used to hate waking up early, but now I love it. One of the benefits for me personally, is that everything after my workout is centered around rebuilding the muscles I just tore down. I'm a lot more conscious of what foods I eat and what my body needs in order to repair. Another benefit is most people aren't working out in the morning so the gym is empty. Whenever I try going to the gym after work, the amount of people there is crazy. It also really messes up my rest times and workouts altogether. But it is really just depends on your schedule and preferences. Conclusion So far, this has been the longest I've ever stuck with anything in my life. The best thing is, my lower back no longer hurts The biggest contribution I believe to my back no longer hurting is core workouts. Planks are a GODSEND. Do them for 10 minutes everyday (take as many rests as you need, but hold the plank for a total of 10 minutes) if you have lower back pain. I usually do them at the end of my workouts on leg days. They've helped a lot with my squats and deadlifts. One of the most rewarding things that has come about this is that I was able to inspire people to workout. I've been religiously recording my progress and transformation over the past year on Facebook and created a page to document my journey and share my experience. It's been working out amazingly well and I have managed to get 100,000 people like and follow my page. It's been an awesome year. I hope this inspired more people like myself to start lifting and to make a change.",

If you're a beginner you might not be able to able to see the same results in a similar time frame. Also since this is not a throwaway account I'd like to remain anonymous in my before and after pictures if it is not against the rules. I started this journey in June 2019 just after finishing my 3rd year of university. I followed a standard 6 day PPL program for the first 2 months with some variations in exercises depending on my fatigue level. For the last 3 months, I could only workout 4-5 times a week (sometimes even lesser) because of my classes and assignments. This was my usual workout routine. &x200B; For PUSH days, Dumbell bench press- 3x(12,10,8) Incline Dumbell bench press- 3x(12,10,8) Dumbell Shoulder press- 3x(12,10,8) Lateral Dumbell Raises or Cable Lateral Raises- 3x12 Cable flies- 3x10 Dumbell Skull crushers- 3x(12,10,8) Tricep rope pushdowns or bench dips- 3x10 &x200B; For PULL days, Wide grip lat pulldown- 3x10 Bent-over Barbell rows- 3x10 Facepulls- 3x10 Single Arm Dumbell rows- 3x10 Incline bench seated dumbell curls- 3x10 Cable curls- 3x10 Shrugs- 3x10 When I got stronger I started to include pullups (3x10) in my routine instead of lat pulldown. & x200B; For LEG days, Squats- 6x(12,10,8,6,5,4) Deadlift- 4x(10,8,6,3) Leg extension- 4x10 Calf raises- 4x15 The most important factor in my workout was progressive overload. I used to increase the weight in subsequent sets and decreased my rep range for most exercises. The rest period between sets was usually 2 minutes. I used to do three 20 min HIIT cardio sessions per week for the first 2 months and for the last 3 months I started doing more low intensity cardio like walking 10-15k steps a day. I used to train my abs 3-4 times a week from the 2nd month onwards and did the usual exercises (hanging leg raises, decline bench crunches, woodchopper, cable crunches, bicycle crunches). I used to perform these exercises in a cycle with a rest period of 5-10 seconds between exercises and did 2 cycles per workout. I didn't track my calories in the first month however from the second month my macros were P: 160g C: 180g, F: 30-35g. My daily calorie intake was around 1900 calories and I decreased this slightly as my weight decreased over time. During the last week of my cut I stopped taking carbs completely and increased my fat intake to deplete my glycogen storage levels. Now the thing I want to stress on is that abs are made in the kitchen. It doesn't matter how often you are training your abs, if you don't bring your body fat percentage down you will never see your abs. My 4 pack started to become visible when I was around 12% body fat. I used to eat completely clean 6 days a week and had a refeed day every Sunday where I would increase my calories to a small surplus. My final body fat percentage was 11.2%. The only supplements I took were whey protein and creatine monohydrate. I plan on starting my bulk from next week as I am taking a break from training for a week. I think I covered most of the stuff but if I missed something out or if you wanna ask something feel free to comment and I'll try to answer your questions.",

I already can accomplish the required physical limits. This topic is about a police special unit. So no endless marches and sleeping in cold mud for days. Nevertheless it's really tough and I want to prepare myself optimal for the tasks. Obviously, I'd be happy if you aren't a member of a special unit but have good knowledge too and answer ;-) 1. FYI Wiki 2. FYI Video 3. Training contents \"marksmanship, tactical training, sports, driver courses, abseiling/rappelling, hand-to-hand combat, language classes, etc. Besides the courses taught in the basic training, further specialization is possible in fields, such as parachuting, diving, explosives, or sniping\" 4. Tasks Anti-terror, personal security for politicians and diplomats, hostage-situation, risky arrests of dangerous criminals, ... 5. My stats I'm a 6'0 ft (185 cm) tall guy and weigh between 187 and 210 lbs (85 kg - 95 kg), depending on my current focus in training. I trained for strenh for a few years and then I just climbed a lot. Started training with weights two months ago. Doing 2x upper and 2x lower body per week, with focus on basic movements (bench, squat, row, deadlift, press, pull-up, lunge). Especially upper body strenh stats are increasing well again and quick at the moment. My current strenh stats are: Pull-Ups: 13 x BW Bench Press: 220 lbs x 10 reps Military Press: 145 lbs x 10 reps Deadlift: 330 lbs x 10 reps Squats: 242 lbs x 10 reps Running stats: 1,86 miles / 3.000 m in 12:05 min 6,2 miles / 10.000 m in 45:36 min My questions I am curious how you guys (if you're members of such a unit) train for being fit optimal on duty. You have to be good at just everything. Muscle endurance, strenh, anaerobic cardio, aerobic cardio, .... How often do you guys hit the weights in the gym? Which routine do you train? How do your stats look like? How often do you do cardio? After leg day it's hard for me to absolve a hard running workout. In what unit do you serve? Thanks in advance.",

    "text": " Often they're a weak link in our bodies, which can result serious injuries putting us out for months. Here's just a few things I've learnt over the past week or so I'd like to pass on to help you guys: Anatomy: The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that acts to stabilise and move the shoulder. It is made up of the: 1. supraspinatus - abducts the arm (equal abduction power as deltoid) 2. infraspinatus - externally rotates the arm 3. teres minor - externally rotates the arm 4. subscapularis - internally rotates humerus (upper arm) Testing flexibility: You may find it useful to gauge how flexible your shoulders are before you begin to stretch them. It helps to see your progress as you increase flexibility in the area. To test your shoulder range of motion: 1. Reach one hand behind the back so that the back of your hand rests on your middle back. Now slide your hand upwards, along the spine, until you reach your shoulder blades. Repeat with both hands, checking if one side can reach further. 2. Do the same but this time reach one hand behind your head and slide it down your neck. Try to reach your shoulder blades again, doing it with both sides. Stretching & Strenhening: Since the muscles making up the rotator cuffs are relatively small in size but are still relied on for a lot of work, this puts them at danger of being torn (due to trauma) or inflamed (from overuse). Here are a few videos and articles, which really helped me: Doing these stretches on a daily basis will definitely help you healthy shoulders, while preventing future injuries. P.S. First \"article\" I've written, tell me if there's anything I can improve on.",

    "text": " Hi All, I have searched google high and low for an answer to this question so I hope you lovely people can help. I have recently gotten back into exercising and specifically weight lifting and want to finally fix a problem that has plagued me all my life. Basically i was born with most of my right hand missing, google crab hand on google images and the literal first image is basically my right hand. The crux of the issue is that my hand ended up smaller than my wrist (I go into more detail below). But in essence any time I pull anything of weight the adaptive aid I use now goes flying. &x200B ; This has meant I have had very limited gripping strenh and no palm to speak of which makes gripping exercises incredibly hard e.g. anything with a lat machine. I have an aid from the company Active Hands which works decently for any pushing exercises (although due to the small wrist size i cant do barbells without causing a decent amount of pain. This is due to all the weight on a tiny wrist area) ,however as my wrist is larger than my hand and gets sweaty mid workout, anytime I attach weight to the aid and pull it invariably ends up flying away from my hand, sometime with hilarious consequences (literally went flying across the gym yesterday when I again attempted the lat machine). As such any advice, recommendations for alternative products or alternative back exercises you all could recommend to get over obstacle I would very very much appreciate.",

I enjoyed doing this and saw some progress, but suffered from fuckarounditis - even though I was tracking all of my workouts using the iOS app Strong, I wasn't working towards any specific goals, hadn't put much thought into creating a balanced program, and frequently neglected leg day and working to make progress on my compound lifts.

I hit 100 lbs lost in the first 6 months and over the last 2 months I've only lost 12 or 13 pounds. I'm going to go in increments of my weight loss and explain from what I can remember how I was feeling. 313-275 was a breeze and came off very quickly. I put little effort into being very accurate with calorie tracking because I was thicc af it just came off anyway 275-260 This was a little bit harder. At this time i was tracking calories very strictly and would keep it to about 1800 a day and was still losing very fast 260-238 This is where I developed an eating disorder and started essentially starving myself. I lied to myself and everyone around me and just said it was fasting but no I was consuming around 4-700 calories a day for about 3 weeks and lost a drastic amount of weight but it just wasn't worth it. I felt like shit all the time. Could only manage to stay awake for 11 or 12 hours at a time and i would sleep for about 10 to 11 hours every night. On top of that my memory became really bad and i was not able to process thoughts quickly because i was just missing nutrients. 238-217 This was all a bit quick but i plateau around 217-218 for a few days and got really upset so i fasted and did triple gym sessions and got over it 217-200 This is where it turned in to a pain in the ass and i have been losing weight slowly. I have destroyed my metabolism and I'm pretty much a wreck and need to start eating maintenance as quick as possible. I lift 7 days a week with 30 minutes of 15 incline walking on 3 speed everyday as well. Become dedicated not motivated. This is a lifestyle change not something you do every once in a while. You can ask me anything and I will answer the question to the best of my knowledge . DIET My diet was super inconsistent but the staples of it were salads, chicken, white rice, oatmeal and chobani flips STARTING NUMBERS BENCH:55 SQUAT:55 DEADLIFT:135 LIFTING NUMBERS NOW BENCH:225 SQUAT:265 DEADLIFT:335 SOME OTHER INTERESTING STATS Waist went from 53inches to 30 inches Shirt size XXL to L Shoe size 12 to 11???? Fat Feet lmao Dick size... nvm but what they say is true Sex went from none to lots Next steps are to get to 185 and decide if I want to bulk or cut from there. I still have some stubborn tummy fat but its understandable I used to be thicc af but I look forward to sculpting myself.",

Is this actually true or could you technically recomp everytime? Next up I wonder where the main difference between cutting and a recomposition is. Both require you to be in a deficit while taking in a lot of protein. Is the only difference the size of the deficit? Also I would like to know \"how\" to train during either of it. Like, should I keep trying to overload which would be fairly hard during a deficit or should I just try and keep going with the heaviest weights I can rep right now as long as possible?

So one \"round\" is 10m I have been experimenting for 3 weeks with the sled push. Since I train legs 3x a week, that means a total of 9 sessions with it. Trying out different weights, distance and rest periods. My primary goal is to increase accelaration and my secondary goal is to increase leg endurance, espeicially for squash. My experience with it, I love it. It feels great and I think it is a decent exercise combining regular squats, box jumps and lunges. My problem is that Im not sure how to program this movement. I have thought it through and I think I can do 2 heavy days and one lighter day. The heavy days being two rounds of max effort, and the lighter days would be a bit longer perhaps 6-10rounds. The heavy days having the goal of increasing acceleration and the lighter day more of an endurance builder. If you ask why I chose those distances, yes I pulled them out from my ass. So my question is, do you program this on max distance covered in a x amount of time, or a predetermined distance fastest as possible? If you think the former, then for how many minutes if the goal is acceleration and for how many minutes for endurance? And if you think the latter, then how far should the distance on the heavy days and on the lighter days. Follow up questions, should i also include reverse sled pulls?

I could ignore how heavy I was. sort of, I was sick all the time, and getting dizzy, and generally feeling horrible. I decided to cut out Soda with sugar. Mothers Day May 11th 2014 - My sister is a Type 2 diabetic and I asked her to check my blood sugar readings after dinner. Hers was 118 and mine was 289. That's not good. In fact, that's the type of number which indicates organ damage if left untreated. May 12th 2014 - The day after Mothers Day I asked my Doctor to run a Fasting Glucose test and it came back at 279 which is really bad. His reaction was, \"You Win.. I told you to cut sugar and lose weight.. you didn't.. so you win the prize. Type 2 Diabetes..\" I love my Doctor, he's a smartass like me. (no, really I do.. good guy.) They put me on the big 3. Metformin, Lisinopril & Simvastatin. Now I'm an adult right? I'm on 3 lifetime medicines for a disease YAY not But, cutting out the sugar in my soda.. I had lost 15 lbs. Hmmmm. so, cutting sugar helps me lose weight. without doing anything else. I've already jacked up my pancreas and won't be using Insulin to get rid of sugar the normal way. so lets just avoid sugar all together. August 2014 - They run this test to check your \"average Blood Sugar levels\" called the A1C which tells them how much sugar was left floating around inside your bloodstream after the insulin did its job. I had quit eating all forms of simple starches.. NO Sugar, NO Bread or Tortillas, NO Pasta, NO Rice, NO Potatoes, NO Simple Starches at all.. TONS of veggies. Broccoli, Cauliflower, Green Beans, Carrots (yes they have a little sugar but they're good for you, hush) Veggies, Veggies, Veggies, and Meat, Lean and not Lean, meat, Meat, MEAT.. I did make a conscious choice to avoid eating bacon and fatty meats often.. I wasn't shooting for a Atkins high level Ketosis state. I was shooting for a state where my body didn't have easy to store Carbs.. I didn't count calories and just ate when hungry.. I portioned out meat.. 8 oz of chicken or beef cubes. frozen in small tupperware containers. and added them to veggies with Sriracha and Soy Sauce. and whatever else caught my fancy. usually Parmesan cheese or a little cheddar. And I walked on a treadmill at the gym. 5x a week for 45 min each time.. and the weight fell off.. I'd lost 60 lbs and was down to 337 and my A1C of 5.3 indicated my average BS was 118 over the past 3 months now. that's still a tad high for a normal person if you use conservative measures of Blood Sugar. and I'm eating no carbs at all but it's safe... November 2014 - They checked my A1C again and it's still at 118 BS (5.3-5.4 A1C range) and I'm down to 297 Lbs (another 40 lbs lost). They're taking me off all of my meds and the issues I have with my back are going away now that my weight is down. I can finally walk with less pain and my limp from the Stenosis in my back is going away. I join a Gym. Feb 2015 - I've been at 280 lbs for the past 2 months. but I've lost inches of fat off my chest and lost multiple inches off my waist and belly. I've been lifting as heavy as possible to build muscle. I would like ideally to make this last part of the conversion a plateau before a fast drop. but the plateau will be a fat burning and muscle building plateau. :) It's a long process.. I'm 44 and not 24.. so the skin doesn't have elasticity it once did.. after I get down to a good weight, I'll have surgery to remove some skin.. which is not... not.. not... pretty.. So I won't be sharing any body pictures in my undies.. sorry Ladies (and Gents who're into that type of thing. ;) ) but I do have a picture from a few days ago.. freshly shaved head.. and full body picture from about a month ago.. although I have lost some belly, you couldn't tell by how I was dressed anyhow. :) I decided to add something in here at the end: When you're working on your own fitness or weight loss plan: 1 Forgive yourself when you mess up. 2 Figure out what triggered the slip. 3 Fix the problem that caused the slip. 4 Forge ahead. We'll call it the 4-F's of dealing with setbacks.. and there will be setbacks. It's a long game. No single mistake or problem will derail the process unless you allow it to. :) Cheers and keep on fighting the good fight",

    "title:": "How my mental health has been affected from sticking to a weight lifting program for the past 6 months",
    "text": " I'll preface this by saying I'm part of a gym that I'm really thankful to be a part of - The trainers encourage you to grow stronger physically and mentally. The owners of the gym have managed to hire on some great people that embody their core values. The trainers are always there to encourage and challenge you. When I first signed up I got some flak from my girlfriend because it is more expensive than most people would consider reasonable for a gym - $150 a month. This was actually a blessing in disguise because when you're spending that much money you're going to show up as much as you can. I started showing up 3x a week and it became a habit. Up until this year the best I had done was stick with P90x for about 3 months at a time and then drop off. This was hard to stick to because I was alone in my living room with no one to push me or help me correct my form. Also I was doing the same 3 workouts 3x a week and never really advancing. One of the first things the coach said to me is that weightlifting is very 'humbling', I don't think I really knew what he meant until recently. When I started, I was a pretty average build with a beer belly and some love handles. Unfortunately I still have a belly and love handles but I have seen more definition in my arms, shoulders and chest than I ever have before. I have realized that even though I've been busting my ass for 6 months and not reached where I expected to be, this isn't some sort of fad diet, it's the beginning of a new lifestyle change for me. This is where I realized that even though I'm not where I thought I would be after 6 months of training, I'm now 100% fine with knowing that I'm in the process of getting better. The mindset shift from \"I'm not where I want to be\" to \"I'm in the process of getting to where I want to be\" has affected all aspects of my life. By making a habit out of weight lifting, I am always feeling like I'm making progress in at least one area of my life. Before I would often compare myself to other people that I would perceive as doing better than me. I recently realized that I no longer compare myself, I've accepted that I'm striving to improve and that's all that I can do. This has in effect 'humbled' me and allowed me to accept that I need to stay consistent in any area of my life to get to where I want to be. I think many of us are guilty of wanting something that we don't yet deserve. Our culture is hooked on instant gratification but it's really the people who put in work that get the real gratification. Now that I'm more at ease about my life, it's easier for me to be grateful for what I have going for me rather than comparing myself to others and noticing what I lack. This training of my body has indirectly been training for my mental health. I've become a little more confident however I have always been a bit over weight and have never been confident taking my shirt off in public. I've never been more certain in my life that I will get there. I have never felt what it's like to be 100% confident with my body but I can imagine that it will have even more positive impacts on my mental health. I'm 27 years old and I live in Florida.... What a waste it would be if I didn't take advantage of this time in my life to become the best version of myself. Atleast I know that in a year from today I will be closer to that goal than I ever have been.",

So anything from that baseline on upwards should be a good starting point (i.e. bodyweight squats and lunges).",

There was an NPR episode that suggested for seniors with limited mobility to sit down and get up from a chair a few dozen times a day to build up strenh. So anything from that baseline on upwards should be a good starting point (i.e. bodyweight squats and lunges).",

Do some of you train specifically for practical shooting? Do you have routines or something I can follow online, like videos or something? Basically a match consists (obviously) of shooting, so using a minimal grip strenh, then there's a lot of sprinting, squatting while shooting in awkward positions, and sometimes ducking and moving through tunnels. So mainly is a lot of cardio work, the match are a some of stages that doesn't last more than 30/40 seconds at worst. The idea is to get faster and develop a good coordination in explosive movements. I don't really need to get a ton of muscles to manage recoil, contrary to what most people think, I just need to be more athletic. Sorry if is a dumb question but I really don't know much about, and tbh I just don't want to waste time and energy in some routine not useful or to get hurt with dumb exercises found randomly online.

I've lifted for 5 years and feel comfortable in providing instruction regarding injury prevention, but am clueless on safe progression with young ones. I took her today, explained and demonstrated how to perform each lift safely, and then had her show and explain her form before every set. She benched 45lbs (the bar) 2x5 and 50 lbs 2x5. Then she squatted 45 lbs 2x5, and 55 lbs 2x5. Then she deadlifted 65 lbs 1x5. She did all of it with ease, except for deadlifts, which I think may be due to the bar being lower to the ground because of the lighter weights bringing the bar lower to the floor. I did not have to save her at all. She loved it and wants to keep going, so how does this progression go? I would assume slowly... if so, how slow?

Usually you should train with your own body weight instead of external weights at her age. For softball she will need both strenh and endurance, so look into running and swimming for endurance, and exercises where she utilizes her own body weight without needing tools or machines to increase strenh in a physiological way.",

    "text": " Hi Reddit Before we get into the transformation I want to give this message to all those in the transformation process. Transforming yourself on the inside is as important if not more so than making the physical transformation. I'll get into this again later, but for me, my physical transformation was just a catalyst for my later inner transformation. And it wasn't until I changed the way I perceived myself, the world, and life in general that my life REALLY change. You can be the biggest/most ripped guy on the planet, but without a good inner base of confidence you will never feel complete/whole. My Transformation I grew up as a skinny little kid. Didn't pass 100lbs until I was 15. Took weight lifting in High School but wasn't very serious about it. Put on a decent amount of muscle for a High Schooler but I was still skinny as hell. Went to college and made getting big my NUMBER one goal. Didn't party, didn't socialize, didn't do sht but lift and read about lifting and playing MMOs(because I was very socially awkward, unconfident, and felt that if I could get big then I could get girls.) Put on about 20lbs that year, bench went from 205 to 255, didn't do a single squat that year hah. From the fall of 2006 to the end of 2008 I took bulking VERY seriously, and I learned more about proper lifting. Primarily followed Madcow's 5x5 program and gained a ton of strenh/size. Also gained a ton of fat as I was eating some ridiculous meals to put on size. A typical dinner for me consisted of at least 350g carbs and 16oz of meat. I seriously think I made myself insulin resistant to the point of being border-line type 2 diabetic in this period. At the end of that time I had terrible energy swings, would literally fall unconscious after large dinners. But I gained size And fat... I started my cut in the Winter of 2008 and that lasted all the way until the fall of 2009. I tried EVERY diet. 40/40/20, velocity diet(where your only source of calories are from 5 protein shakes a day for 28 days- terrible, never do this), carb cycling, keto, high fat, low fat, high carb, low carb. You name it, I tried it. Settled on keto and carb cycling as the most effective for me. Dropped down to 187, lost quite a bit of strenh, definitely lost some muscle mass(especially during velocity diet). Today I am a healthy 195. I've been at this weight for the last two years. This seems to be a good homeostasis point. I like the weight because I can be strong/big and yet still pretty athletic(I'm in the Army so I need to be able to run). I'm a firm believer that squats and deads are fundamental to developing a well-rounded physique. GO SQUAT Also for anyone interested, I made a which could be useful information on learning more in-depth ideas about training. Now let me talk about inner change. After I got \"ripped\" in 2009 I realized that life didn't change much. Sure I got more attention from people and girls, but I still felt unconfident. I still sucked with women. I still was shy and timid. Note- I realize getting girls is not the sole purpose of life, but for someone in their 20's it is still a very important issue- especially if you CAN'T attract the kind of women you want to date, and that's why I keep hitting on that issue. That's when I really got serious with self development. Read a ton of books and worked on my inner being. A few examples of exercises I did- I would walk around and force myself to hold eye-contact with every person walking by me on campus(insanely difficult at first). I consciously talked louder. I made myself aware of how my body language was at all times. Little things like that, which over time, really helped me to grow confident in myself. Today I absolutely love life. I love it and I live it with zeal. I've been able to land great jobs because of my confidence and social skills developed over the last few years. I've started my own business that brings in about 1k a month after 8 months. I was able to do this because of the confidence I gained and the realization that anything is possible with disciplined hard work. So my message to all of you is that you can change EVERYTHING about yourself. You can change your appearance, and you can change your attitude toward life. You can change your limiting beliefs. You can change how people perceive you, and you can change how you perceive life. And just to put a little plug in, I have built a and that is dedicated to helping nerdy gamers become fit, active, and confident(because I grew up addicted to UO/EQ/WoW). My passion in life is helping others realize the potential hidden within them. We all have within us the seed of greatness. It is up to you to awaken and nurture that seed until it propels you into the life that you've always known you deserved. Go out there. Take action. Make it happen.

    "text": " The title pretty much says it all. . But I know not everybody needs to watch a 6-minute video to understand how to use a foam roller, so I made looping GIF's of it to help save you time. That's just how much I love foam rollers. What is a foam roller? How does it work? A foam roller is a self massage tool. During a deep tissue massage, someone typically kneads their fingers/palms/elbows into you and it feels good... right? Well, instead of someone massaging you, you roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to get the knots out and relax your muscles. So, that's why I have one. It's like getting free massages for the rest of your life. Foam Rolling GIFs (avoid lower back and neck) (not meant to be aggressive) (lateral side to get anterior tibialis) (bent legs and/or straight legs) Note: You don't have to constantly roll back and forth. Sometimes, just putting pressure on ONE tender spot and holding it for 30-60sec is effective, too. I just wanted to show you the simple motions you could do. Let me know how you like it And have a good time rolling",

A lot of dips, push ups, and hundreds of squats a day since it's only body-weight am I right? I got the newb gains, but I was ignorant in the nutrition area, so I didn't really progress much further in size. Fast-forward to now where I have a consistent schedule and more knowledge in overall health and fitness, I reached my goal and then some. M/23/5'9\"(178cm) SW: 87.5kg/193lb, CW: 77.11kg/170lbs, GW: 160-165lbs but that's for the cut of 2021 Current Physique(2020): Some Pictures from 2019: Before and After Pic: Cut/Bulk Pics: Current Calorie Maintenance: 2700-3000 Macros: 30P/20F/50C &x200B; Diet: Nothing out of the ordinary, I eat pretty much every protein source that are on the leaner side just to hit my macros. Lots fruits every meal. White rice for carbs, whole wheat tortillas, pita bread, and oatmeal. I used to follow intermittent-fasting, but ever since I've been working from home, I have more time to prepare my meals so now I have about 4 meals a day. Sauces I cook with: Rice vinegar, low-sodium soy sauce, low-calories marinara sauce Sauces I use with these meals: Sugar free Ketchup, Sugar Free BBQ, low fat mayonnaise, mustard, hot siracha Ever since I've hit my desired weight I've been more laxed with my diet having cheat meals here and there with no care regards to macros hehe. Oh, and Splenda with everything. & x200B; Workout Program: I've been following the Reddit PPL beginner program with a few changes for about 2 years and I don't plan on switching programs yet. I decreased the amount of sets on the main lifts because my body wasn't recovering fast enough as I added more weights to the bar. Other than that, I pretty much know how my body will respond depending on how hard I train during any particular day. If I train balls to the walls, I end up being sore for the next 5 days and it definitely affects my performance throughout the week and my hunger levels skyrockets(not good for staying lean). I found that if I put just enough stimulations to muscles, I could still get them gains without going nuts every training session. The over-all goal is to never bulk up again and stay lean year round. & x200B; 2019 Lifts: Deadlift: 120.2kg/265lb (3x5) Bench: 88.4kg/195lb, (4x5, 1x5+) Squat: 108.9kg/240lb (4x5, 1x5+) OHP: 54.4kg/120lb (4x5, 1x5+) Current lifts: Deadlift: 174.6kg/385lb (1x7 w/ 3x5 of warm up sets) Bench: 97.5kg/215lb, (3x5, still got a long way to go before I hit 2 plates) Squat: 104.3kg/230lb (3x5, Squats are much harder at a lighter bw) OHP: 54.4kg/120lb (3x5, Also much harder at a light weight ) Cardio: I would love to do some cardio but I don't have time. &x200B; Stretch: I don't have time anymore to stretch before and after like I used to. Sleep: 7-8 hours. I'm very strict on my sleeping schedule, so I make sure to sleep at the same time every night! Lifestyle: 8 hours of desk job, so I try to move as much as possible. I also don't drink alcohol or smoke. Supplements(Changed from last years stack): Fish-Oil Whey Protein Vitamin D Beta-Alanine",

    "title:": "6 months on PPL & moderate calorie deficit",
    "text": " I am 27 years old and 6'4\" I bulked from (skinny fat, regularly lifted for about a year) to (fat) in 9 months. I was eating pretty “clean”, but just a lot of food. I sporadically tracked my calorie intake and I was eating close to 4,000 calories a day with 300g+ protein. I was gaining about 1-2lbs a week towards the end of the bulk. My training program was 7 days a week weight training (split: back and bicep, chest and tricep, legs, shoulders). Also, every other day 30-40 minutes MISS cardio (10 mile stationary bike, hill training mode). I was not logging my workouts but I was getting stronger and bigger (mostly fat). I decided to get serious with my diet and exercise routine and that’s when I noticed rapid progress. I began a cut and my goal was to get to sub-10% bodyfat in 4-6 months for beach vacations this summer. I used by Jeremy Ethier to as a guide for how to plan my diet. I used by Jeff Nippard as a guideline for how to eat. For the entire diet I was eating 220g+ protein and 20-30% calories from fat, the rest was carbs. I shot for 1-2lb fat loss per week and when I reached a plateau I either 1: Reduced my daily calorie intake by 50-100, usually from carbs. OR 2: Increased my daily activity level by adding a small amount of LISS cardio. I weighed and cooked 95% of my food, and logged 100% of my food in MyFitnessPal. I weighed myself every morning and tracked my average weekly weight to see through daily fluctuations. I also stopped drinking alcohol completely during this cut. I began a 6 day PPL routine and began logging my workouts to track my progress and ensure I was progressively overloading my lifts. I designed my own programs that looked like and took deload weeks every 8-12 weeks and switched up the exercises afterwards. I was doing tons of volume in my routine, 20 sets per body part per week minimum. I would do 6-8 exercises per session and do the compounds first, doing 4 sets in the 8-10 rep range. Isolations came next with 3 sets in the 10-15 rep range. I would progressively overload by adding 1 or 2 reps each session until I reached the rep range ceiling. Then, up the weight and start at the bottom of the rep range. For example, a bench press one session would go Set 1: 185 x 10, Set 2: 185 x 10, Set 3: 185 x 9, Set 4: 185 x 9. The next session I would try for 4 sets of 10 with 185. After hitting that, I would increase the weight to 190 and try for 4 sets of 8. Rinse and repeat. I pushed myself and went close to failure on every set (8+ RPE), with ample rest between sets (3 minutes for compound, 2 minutes for isolation). I kept a timer going for the entire session to ensure the proper rest time and to make sure I was having enough time under tension. I aimed for at least 30 seconds TUT, but ideally 40 seconds per set. Because of this, my weight training takes about 1h 30m per day. I averaged about 50 minutes of LISS cardio every day (walking outside or incline treadmill) and began stretching 30-45 mins per day. I was also getting adequate rest, 7+ hours most nights. I got down to 181lbs carb depleted. 2 days later carb loaded I was 190lb and . 3 weeks prior I was 10.7% body fat according to a DEXA scan, so I would estimate I am somewhere around 9% at my peak. I did not miss a single workout. I went on a couple diet breaks (1 full week about 4 months in and 1 weekend 5 months in). Other than that, I stuck to my diet and didn’t cheat. I had meals that were “dirty”, but I fit them in my macros. I used Greg Doucette’s cookbook for a lot of my meals. I learned from Jeff Nippard, Greg Doucette, Jeremy Ethier, Renaissance Periodization and a few others on YouTube how to diet, train, and supplement. All my lifts increased. I am dealing with a herniated disk and AC joint sprain, so I had to work around the big 3 (squat, deadlift, flat bench). But for reference I was able to go from 140lb to 270lb hack squat (for reps of 10) and on bench press I went from 185lb 4RM to 225lb in 4 months before my shoulder prevented me from going further. I have been adding 10lb per month on my incline DB bench since starting, going from 60lb to 85lb in 3 months. My waist is 4 inches smaller at the same body weight as a year ago. If I could go back and change anything I would not have bulked up so heavy. I was chasing the number on the scale and wanted to get big. I didn’t use the mirror like I should have to gauge progress. A “dirty bulk” or “dreamers bulk” is not the way to go. It took me 6 MONTHS of strict dieting to strip away that fat. I probably lost a good amount of muscle in the process. Bulk up slow. Do body recomposition, or “gain-taining” if you are only 10-20lbs overweight. Find quality, evidence based sources of information online, like the YouTube channels I mentioned. Some things you just need to learn for yourself, but there’s a lot of advice that’s worth hearing.",

    "text": " Friends, I am a long time lurker and occasional commenter. On St Patricks Day this year, (the 17th of March), I committed to actually getting my shit together and going to the gym. I'd had a terrible year the year before, where I had gained around 15kg, and my health was suffering. I was physically ruined, felt bad about my body, and wanted to regain the former athleticism of my teenage years. It has been 9 months, and I've made noticeable but not ridiculous gains. I would like to share my progress with you. BASIC INFO: I am 5'10\", or 178cm Starting weight: 86kg/190lbs Final weight: 75kg/165lbs Progress Pictures: Current: Before: Middle: Current best sets for each lift: Bench: 90kg (200lbs) for 2 OHP: 62.5kg (137.5lbs) for 2 Deadlift: 157.5kg (347.5lbs) for 4 Squat: 125kg (275lbs) for 3 While not strictly taken straight from the couch, as I had already lost around 4kg when it was taken, the before pic gives you a good idea of where I was at to start off. The current pic was taken yesterday. All 3 were taken in 3 different bathrooms with different lighting, so it's not a perfect comparison, but it gives you the gist of it. NUTRITION: The first thing I did after browsing a few forums was download MyFitnessPal. I estimated my TDEE at around 2800, and set my macros to 2200 calories a day, with 220g carbs, 165g protein, and 73g fat. While I, like nobody, was perfect, I worked really hard on my nutrition, and was within a hundred or so calories and 15g or so of protein virtually every day for the first 6 months. For breakfast, I either ate oats, or omelettes with ham and cheese, full cream milk, and rye bread. For lunch I'd have a smoothie with a banana or some berries, 100g of greek yoghurt, a scoop of whey protein, some honey, and full cream milk again. Usually for dinner I'd have whatever we were having at the house, (pasta, fish, steak, chicken stir fry, etc) and if I needed to top up to meet my goals at the end of the day, I would have a small shake, but usually that wasn't necessary. I never snacked, ever. I have basically kept these macros until this day. I stopped losing weight around 4 months in when I reached my goal weight of 75kg, but since it's Australian summer, I'm not too desperate to bulk just yet. A recomp has been going fine, and my habits are so ingrained that I find it hard to deviate. LIFTING: I actually started with StrongLifts 5x5, but after about 4 weeks, I had learned the lifts, and was beginning to stall. I injured my knee in a game of football and did some upper body fuckaroundosis for about 4 more weeks. Once my knee was better, I was looking for a program, and I came across a great one over at r/nsuns. I started on the 5 day version, but since my squat fell behind due to a the knee, I transitioned to 6 day squat to catch it up, and have been doing that version since. I have de-loaded three times, each time with great results in the cycle immediately after. I love the program, it's amazing for the big lifts and gives me plenty of room to fit in accessories and some cardio. A few things I learned along the way were seemingly obvious now. Leave your ego at the door. Everything takes time. Get enough sleep. Ultimately though my biggest takeaway was that every time I came up against an obstacle, the best way to get past it was to keep healthy and keep lifting. My deadlift struggled off the floor, so I ate right, watched my form videos, and kept deadlifting. It got better. My bench stalled for 4 weeks, so I ate right, I de-loaded, and benched more. It got better. My OHP struggled at lockout, so I ate right, did some tricep accessories, and pressed more. It got better. Unless I am feeling pain, I usually know that the best way to get past any kind of struggle in lifting is to trust the process. I check my form, hit my macros, embrace the grind, and get stronger. I have loved that part of the experience of lifting and it has been great for my confidence to overcome obstacles this way. I really appreciate everything I've learned on r/fitness over the last 9 months, as this is only the start of a lifelong journey in fitness that i'm incredibly relieved I started so young. CONCLUSION: When I first lost weight, I noticed I could sleep better, and get out of bed more easily. One thing that really scared me was that I noticed when lying down once, having lost about 10kg, that my heart was beating noticeably slower. These habits matter, and they affect our health long term. The past nine months was a real wake up call, and I'm grateful for forums like this where we can share information and inspiration to make a change in our lives. Like I said, this is only the start. I hope anyone who is new can see the kind of difference you can make if you just get started! God speed friends, we're all gonna make it.",

    "text": " After 3+ years of trying, i finally was able to do my first pullup! I have a mild disability called Erb’s Palsy which has given me a 3” difference in arm lenh. Being able to finally do this was super important to me. I've tried to do one about once a week but it's always felt like I was literally tearing my shoulder to pieces. The biggest help, I think, was learning how to actually activate my lats in the deadlift. Once I figured out how to do that for stability, I was able to get them more active in the bench, and in variations of rows (lat pull down, seated row, t bar, etc). I believe that I have always been able to activate the left lat properly but not the right one, which really shows in my physique (and stability on both sides of my body). Lately I’ve been treating the LPD as a shorter movement and trying to very specifically pull with even force on both sides. Generating evenly distributed force is something that’s always been an issue for all of my lifts. Learning a better activation will hopefully get my bench out of the gutter as well. I’m heavily incorporating incline bench, slingshot bench and dumbbell bench in my current training cycle to give myself some additional practice while building my lagging stabilizer muscles. Current program: GZCL Jacked & Tan. Previously: Sheiko, Texas Method, Beyond 531, some BulgMet style randomness. I’m not sure I’ll try these again for a while, they didn’t feel that great and I don’t think they fit into my current programming but it was fun to do once. If anyone has any questions about training, programming or living feel free to fire away.",

      "Thanks man! I have a mild disability called Erb’s Palsy which has given me a 3” difference in arm lenh.",
      "Well done. I'm just getting to first pullup set - with 20 lbs of assist I can do a 4 sets with sloppy form, and my arms are the same lenh. So you're beating the hell out of me.",

      "Wow, that's pretty crazy too! The biggest help, I think, was learning how to actually activate my lats in the deadlift.",
      "but I'm trying to visualize in my mind how a 3 inch difference would make doing pull-ups. Would it require different muscles or stability or what. Or does the erbs cause a difference in muscle strenh as well?",
      "Both. Once I figured out how to do that for stability, I was able to get them more active in the bench, and in variations of rows (lat pull down, seated row, t bar, etc).",
      "Hey I also have different lenh arms. Except mine is due to breaking the growth plate in my humerus bone when I was 15, so it stopped growing with the rest of my body. I've found that dedicating 1 day per week specifically to individual shoulder workouts (no barbells) has helped immensely with shoulder stability and I no longer have random dislocations from the targeted training.",

The first more obvious one is an increase in both number and size of muscle fibers.",

By it's natural, fast twitch muscles cannot work over an extended amount of time.",
      "is usually viewed as the hardest true sprint. Same for deadlifting, I've done the Dan John 50 Squat rep challenge () twice, failing the first time, and the only difference was working to increase my strenh through 5 and Dynamic efforts across 3 months.",
      "This is a case of the general principle that increasing strenh can increase endurance. When you begin training strenh there are two main physiological adaptations that allow your body to lift heavier weights. The first more obvious one is an increase in both number and size of muscle fibers.",
      "I know these things work by experience, but it doesn't seem to link up with what I actually have read.",
      "Thus the same outcome, such as maintaining a given power output for a period of time, is achieved with less energy/resources by the muscles. For example suppose you're a cyclist who's never strenh trained. You begin going to the gym and training squats in the strenh weight/rep range.",
      "How does this work?",
      "(From my own experience, I am pretty sure there's a motor-training aspect to running fast reps that carries over to slower paces, too, though I'm not actually sure how well supported that is. Anyone else?) Also, depending on the rest periods and intensities involved, you can get a lot of different adaptations from ' intervals'.",
      "About the motor training, that would make sense."

    "title:": "M/21/5'7''. 3 Year Transformation. 130 lbs to 160 lbs. My journey from the scrawny soccer player to what I am today.",
    "text": " So after almost 3 years of lifting I feel proud enough to share my journey with you all. Where everything started I was always the scrawny kid. I played soccer since I was 6 years old and was pretty athletic - but that was it. I was about 130 lbs (59 kg) at 5'7'' (170 cm) when I turned 18. After finishing high school in Germany, I was given the opportunity to go to the US for a year and work as an intern. During that time I started something called Freeletics, a german bodyweight / cardio program, which promised great muscular results after 12 weeks. I completely neglected my diet and even lost weight during that time. I quit about half way through and decided I had to gain weight no matter what it takes. Going to the gym in the states I started going to the high school gym (the high school my guest families kids went to) about two or three times a week, where we followed a training regime given to us by the gym coach. He actually thought I was an exchange student for about half a year, haha. It was pretty much a full body powerlifting workout. We deadlifted, squatted and benched, doing a few acessories here and there. I was really lucky to have proper guidance from the start, so I didn't waste a lot of time doing uneffective workouts. He also drilled us to eat a lot. I pretty much used myfitnesspal from the get go (shooting for 3500 kcal in my first year) and bulked to about 148 lbs (67 kg). I think I benched 185 lbs (84 kg), squatted 250 lbs (113 kg) and deadlifted 275 lbs (125 kg) when I left the states. Back home Back in Germany I moved out to study in a bigger city about 4 hours away from home. Now I could cook for myself and go the gym without relying on someone to drive me I was psyched. I started a PPL routine, but soon switched to a classic upper lower split, due to schedule issues. I just couldn't make it to the gym 6 times a week. I continue to follow this routine until today. Bench is 250 lbs (113 kg). I haven't actually squatted or deadlifted in a long time. The last time I deadlifted, my 1 rep max was 350 lbs (160 kg). Upper: Bench Press 3x6-8 Incline DB Press 3x6-8 T-bar Rows 3x6-8 Close grip lat pulldowns 3x6-8 Overhead Press 2x6-8 Later DB Raises 2x6-10 Incline seated DB curles 3x6-10 Overhead DB Tricep Press 3x6-10 Lower: Hacksquats 3x6-8 Leg Press 3x6-8 SLDL 3x6-8 Lying leg curls 3x6-10 Machine calf raises 3x8-12 Cables Crunches 3x8-12 What my diet looks like right now Honestly, I have never cut in my life, so I only know how to ride the bulk train. My heaviest was around 170 lbs (77 kg), but after a few months of not being able to lift I am back at around 160 lbs (73 kg) at the moment. I shoot for 3200 kcal (at least 130 g protein). A nice clean, slow bulk. Due to dairy and nut intolerances that I just discovered I have had to change quite a bit in my diet. Breakfast (800 kcal): 2 rolls with chocolate spread Glas of juice and cup of coffee Lunch (500 kcal): Toast with margerine and sliced chicken breast Roasted Sunflower seeds as a side, just to snack on Shake (900 kcal): Oats, Soymilk, frozen berries, a banana, linseeds and olive oil Dinner (1000 kcal): This varies a lot. I try to get a good amount of protein at dinner. I like stir-frying and steak with sweet potatoes and veggies, and so on - anything's allowed as along as I hit my 1000 kcal. Of course I try to sleep as much as possible. I get in about 8 hours every night, weekends vary. I am sure I could have had even better progress cutting out alcohol completely, but I can honestly say that a few beers on the weekend really didn't kill my gains. Supplements 5 g creatine Fish oil Whey protein (I stopped putting it in my shake when I discovered my dairy intolerance) Final words Can't describe how lifting benefited my life. It taught me discipline and made me much more confident. The first few months in 2016 were hard for me, I wasn't able to workout consistently due to work related stuff and lost quite a bit of the muscle. I was devasted how weak I was when I got back in the gym, but I pushed myself and started building the habit again. For me it is all about building habits. After 3 years one would think it is a no brainer to get off the couch and go the work out, but for me it is a continious struggle to stay motiviated. Eating enough is super hard for meas well and I have to remind myself everday to hit my goal, but when you're persistant and trust the process without looking to far into the future and being overwhelmed by the path in front of you, everything is possible.",

    "text": " ARNOLD’S PAGE DON’T BE A CHICKEN BUILD YOUR PHYSIQUE FROM THE GROUND UP I had a great time doing my photo shoot this month. It was a blast from the past. I could almost hear Joe Weider yelling at me, “Come on Arnold, pull in your stomach” But as I looked around, I saw people pumping up their chests, doing ab work, and curling. I also saw a plague spreading. If you’ve been in a gym recently, you might have noticed it, too. It’s ripping through gym rats like the flu: CHICKEN LEGS. You’ve seen the guy in the corner of the gym doing 20 sets of curls Monday, hitting his chest from every angle on Wednesday, and nailing his shoulders on Friday. But what about legs? Somehow, despite all of his workouts, this guy never finds time for his legs. He walks around the gym looking like he might fall over any minute, with his huge upper body and his skinny legs. Or maybe he’s the one who suspiciously wears long sweat pants, even though he’s wearing a tank-top that doesn’t leave anything about his chest or arms to the imagination. This is one of my pet peeves. People love to do their bench-press sets. They love to do their curls. I’ve heard them talk about their hot tub muscles, or say things like, “Sun’s out, guns out” But if you are leaving half of your body unworked, you can never consider yourself truly fit. I don’t care how ripped your six-pack is, or if you have 18-inch biceps. I don’t care if you can bench 500 pounds. Work your legs. I can’t say it enough. You don’t think your glutes, your thighs, and your calves matter? They are some of the biggest muscles in your body. They are your primary movers and shakers. And let’s not forget: A muscular set of legs always looks good. The chicken leg phenomenon points to a bigger issue. When you work half of the body over and over but completely neglect the other half, you’re leaving results on the table. You have to focus on the whole body. You need to see the big picture. In the same way, even if you aren’t in the gym every day pumping up your pecs—if you just picked up this magazine because you said, “Oh, Schwazenschnitzel is on the cover”—you also need to see the big picture. Because your health is a big-picture thing. If you’re lifting, but still smoking a pack a day, you’re doing the same thing the curling king with chicken legs is doing: You’re leaving results on the table. Whatever it means for you, find a big-picture approach to your fitness—and try not to catch that chicken legs virus. Yours in Iron, Arnold Schwarzenegger",

    "title:": "My little sister deadlifted at 140 - 2.5 times her own body weight!",
    "text": " Hey guys Some of you probably remember when I first introduced my little sister and pupil, Michelle, on here after she hit her first 315 pound deadlift last August. Well, last week she hit another huge landmark by pulling a solid 350 pound deadlift at a body weight of 140 - 2.5 times her own body weight. I also found this 350 to be significant because it's exactly double what she could deadlift when she first started, which is kind of cool. As for her training, we kind of revamped things after she pulled the 315. We adjusted her technique a bit (compare the 315 to the 350: 350 has a more compact stance, a slightly narrower grip, utilization of the stretch reflex, the pull is no longer initiated by \"yanking\" the bar from the floor, etc.) and we got her a real powerlifting belt. We wanted to give her some time to get used to the new technique and break in the belt somewhat/get a feel for it, so we started off the cycle pretty light at 225lbs, which was about 70% of her maximum at the time. We ran a basic 5x5 once a week, adding 5 pounds each session. We did this until she got up to somewhere around 265-270 for 5 sets of 5, if I recall correctly. At this point we changed things up a bit. Instead of running a linear progression we switched to more of a \"ramping\" style to increase the intensity. The goal was to work up to a heavy set of 3 each session. After she hit the heaviest triple of the day we would take 30-50lbs off the bar and knock out a few more sets of 3 to accrue some more volume. We ran this progression style for the next several months until she pulled 320lbs for a solid set of 3. At this point we decided to test the deadlift with the goal of hitting 350. During this time period she was also squatting twice a week, one heavy and one volume day, as well doing some benching/pullups twice a week after each squat session. She also does some form of cardio 2-3 times a week, but she does that on her own so I don't know too much about it. As for where we go from here, I think we will continue to train with the ramping style for a little bit longer and see if she can eek out a bit more progress that way. The short term goal is obviously to get that extra quarter on the bar by pulling 365. I think she can do that if we continue with this cycle. After that we will most likely start all over again with a new training cycle by dropping back down to the 70% range. The goal then will be the big 4 plate landmark. I know she can get there, she just needs a few more years under her belt. But I've always talked about it as an inevitability rather than a possibility and so I'm pretty sure there isn't a doubt in her mind that she will get it soon enough. Anyway, if you have any questions about her training feel free to ask me",

I found I had (unsurprisingly) a lot of hip tightness and for the first time in my life I was quad dominant instead of glute dominant and it totally changed my approach to lifting when I got back to it.",

    "text": " In my experience LSD 10 - 15ug (1/10 of the standard street dose) is almost the perfect preworkout. - Edit - This is not a recommendation that anyone tries microdosing as a pre workout! These are simply the effects I observed. Don’t follow in my footsteps, I’m a dumbass. - LSD is nontoxic and nonaddictive, but can be dangerous for those with mental disorders like schizophrenia. If you struggle with your hold on reality then please avoid psychedelics and psychotropic drugs in general (including peds). I would also avoid it if you have a substance use disorder as like all drugs it can be abused. Below is my list of all the performance related effects of microdosing lsd. Effects - Increased energy - The increased energy is potent but never feels forced and one can sit still if need be but one feels encouraged to move. This is comparable to a average dose of caffeine and lasts approx 8 hours. Appetite suppression - This effect is far stronger then what is provided by caffeine and can rival a low dose of amphetamine (this also lasts around 8 hours so it’s perfect for a fast). Eating big meals can become impossible and small meals of fruits and oats are preferred. Wakefulness aid - This effect is more then just the increased energy mentioned above. Most people will find it impossible to sleep within 8-12 hours after LSD, even at a microdose. This effect is most comparable to 150mg of modafinil. Increased strenh - I always find that I can lift more / perform more reps after a microdose. It’s almost like my mental limiter has been removed. This effect is most pronounced within the first 4-6 hours of the experience. Euphoria - LSD can be very euphoric.",

Flavors range from vanilla and chocolate whey iso to cookies and cream casein. Low and behold I have no milk. This mix with water is not something I want to try again so hmm... what can I mix it with. No yogurt, no juice, no ice cream GOT IT! cottage cheese is all I have. Why not, what could go wrong? So I mix about 2/3 scoop into the cottage cheese and it turns into a grey dough ball lump with white chunks in it. The taste is off the charts foul. I am chewing this mix like last weeks congealed oatmeal with the benefit of the moist cottage cheese curds that almost pop in my mouth, when I decide it needs a little texture to help. I mix in a small handful of granola. This does not make it any better. Now its a grey goo with crunchy bits and the curds still explode as I bite into them. All I could think about is bugs and critters getting chewed up for the sake of gainz. 1/10 will drink with water next time.",

    "text": " Okay, so I am a 29 year old fat woman who wants to run her first 5k before she turns 30. That 5K is on January 2nd. So here's the details. My highest weight ever was 325 (5'8\"), and I am currently around 278. I am doing 3 full body strenh training workouts each week, and then doing my runs alternating 3 days a week, with one day of rest. I also walk at least another 2-4 miles a day during my work breaks. I am also eating at a caloric deficit using My Fitness Pal, and getting plenty of protein. So here's my question. I have completed the couch to 5K program in that I can successfully jog for 3.11 miles without needing to walk or stop. My problem is that I am very, very, very slow at it. My current best time is around 53 minutes. I would love to get at least somewhat faster by the time I do the 5k. What kinds of things can I do to get faster at this in the 8 weeks before the race? In the end, being able to complete the race jogging/running without stopping is my goal (Something I've never done in my life), but I'd love to be able to really do my best. Any help/advice is greatly appreciated. Edited to add: I have learned that I am not jogging in any sense of the word, and am instead shuffling. I realize this now, and would still love any help/advice to shuffle faster until I can actually jog like a normal person. Edited again: I don't think I particularly deserve gold at this point, but thank you to whomever bestowed it. I'll feel more deserving when I'm able to complete the 5K on January 2nd after training diligently and not fucking myself up by trying too hard. I really appreciate all your advice and good wishes, and I am reading all of it.",

    "title:": "The 5 toughest workout routines that exist, in my opinion (in no particular order):",
    "text": " 1. I'm not a big fan of the whole Xfit thing, but this is not for the faint of heart. Imagine doing a full body workout and high intensity cardio at the same time, and you get this, an extreme circuit training workout. You have to do 50 reps of 10 different exercises, with no break in between the exercises, and as fast as humanly possible while keeping a good form. I did this a couple times back when I was mostly concerned with losing body fat, and as someone who's more into weight lifting than cardio, this was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It's good for all athletes, because it challenges your muscular strenh, muscular endurance and cardiovascular ability all at once. 2. Possibly the toughest powerlifting and squat routine that exists. This is part of Smolov' 15 week powerlifting routine, the base cycle of which is also used for the bench press and a few others compound exercises. The whole Smolov routine is also known as 'The Test', because it will test whether you actually know what you are doing when it comes to nutrition and weight lifting. This is by no stretch of the imagination a cutting program, and it is critical that you rest and eat properly, and that you lift with a good form. If you go through it doing everything correctly, you will come out a LOT stronger than you were before starting; if you don't, at best you will have poor strenh gains, and at worst, you will also come out with an injury. If things don't go well during the base cycle, do not even attempt this. 3. Possibly the greatest mass-building training routine, this isn't complex, or long, it's just brutally painful. 2 exercises in one superset, 1 push and 1 pull, 90 sec. of rest in between each superset, and 10 series of 10 reps for each of the two exercises, all with a 4-0-2 tempo. You're basically lifting for 20 minutes over a period of one hour. I did this recently, and made some spectacular muscular mass gains. I also ate like a horse while doing this. 4. An extreme and heavy-weight version of circuit training that is mainly used by bodybuilders in their cutting phase. Possibly the best workout for losing bodyfat and maintaining muscular mass and strenh as much as possible at the same time. Even though this is a workout designed for general conditioning and bodyfat loss, I would not attempt this while being on more than a slight caloric deficit. 5. This training program has a single exercise: the platform snatch grip deadlift. It's possibly the best weight lifting exercise that exists, and it's certainly one of the best muscle building exercises out there. You can add some complementary exercises, mostly ones that will help you with the deadlifting itself, but this exercise alone will leave your entire body exhausted. Do not attempt this unless you have mastered the regular deadlift form, obviously. This is my personal top 5. Do you guys know any other brutally hard weight lifting routines?",

    "text": " Hey all I have some very limited experience in lifting; I have followed programs sporadically and worked with a trainer for a month here and there but I would say I'm effectively still a beginner. The program I've just started is based on %ages of ORM. The trainer I was working with previously actually recommended it. My question is when and how I should calculate ORM. I have a squat cage at home as well as an Olympic bar and dumbbells, but I don't have anyone to lift with and am kind of nervous to try maxing out myself. I also feel like until I have someone there for safety I won't go to max. I need to get ORM for most of the major Barbell/Dumbbell exercises. I'm also not sure if the dumbbells I have will go high enough for me to max out (30 per hand max). My questions are: 1. Do I do it on a normal workout day? Should I do it on a rest day and count that as my accessory/cardio work? 2. Is there a safe way to do it alone with safety bars, etc? Or should I just schedule a time with a friend who can spot. Would it be better to get into an actual gym for this process? 3. How often should I try to update this/repeat the process? I'm sure over time its going to change. 4. How should I handle ORM for exercises that don't use weights (band, bodyweight like dips, etc)? 5. What are the other ways people determine workload? Seems like there are a lot of different ideas/programs out there. I think its not so tough to determine which exercises to do but how do you know when you've worked enough or too much? In any case, I am going to be sticking with this program to completion before I start looking into 5. Thanks everyone",

Correct form is as follows: From a dead hang with locked out elbows, pull yourself up until your chin goes above the bar. Then, lower yourself down until your elbows lock out again. Do no swing your legs or kip yourself up. If you're starting at a low number, adjust the routine to fit your ability. This is not a good routine for beginners. Workout A: High rep (1 min between sets) 1-100 pull-ups 12, 16, 12, 12, 18, 10, 10, 10 100-150 pull ups Do sets of 4-6 reps until you hit 150. Alternate between wide grip, l-sit pull ups, side-to-side pull ups (not sure this is the correct term) and as many other forms of pull ups you can think of and as always, use perfect form every time. Workout B: High weight (1.5 min between sets) Use a dip belt 12 reps with 35 lb w/ 4x pull up holds until failure, 10 reps with 45 lb w/ 4x pull up holds until failure 3 reps with 70 lb w/ 3x pull up holds until failure 8 reps w/ 45 lb w/ 4x pull up holds until failure 10 reps with 35 lb w/ 4x pull up holds until failure I alternate these workouts and perform them before every single workout. Now on to 40 reps Does anybody have any tips for me? The next 8 reps is gonna be killer and I need all the help I can get. I hope this was helpful to any of you.",

Quickly a employee of the gym stops the confrontation and thats the end of it. People at the gym were like wtf is that guys problem yada yada. One of his buddies later on comes up to me and sort of apologies for how his friend acted and said he has issues and that he is 16. Mind you he is about 5'8 and thick. Like probably around 225 pound a lot of muscle. I honestly thought he was around my age or maybe a few years younger. So I just told his friend dont worry about it, its not a big deal. Well today I went to the gym and he was there with his chronies. I noticed him staring at me multiple times, but just ignored him. On my way out of the locker room, he happened to pass by with his chronies, obviously was staring me down, I just smiled and as I passed by he says \"bitch\" and does one of those pro wrestling \"Wooo's\" Honestly I hate to say it, but he drives me nuts, in my younger days I would of done something, however I have a great job and a lot of other reasons why I dont smash his face with a brick. Any advice for this jobber?",

A better alternative to start would be goblet squats and kickbacks/fire hydrants. For shoulders, doing overhead press may be beneficial at a light weight but it would be a better idea to start with resistance bands to ensure that his shoulder health is optimal.",

For chest, bench press is definitely a good workout but his wrists may not be up for it and can easily become injured if the grip isn't proper.",
      "Dumbbell bench press would be a more viable option as it is much easier to maintain proper wrist positioning and there is much less tension without the fixed bar across both arms.

It's the same if you start from your house, etc. For me personally, if I run on a track/treadmill, it's really easy for me to say \"I'm tired. I've done enough,\" regardless of how far I've actually ran. I try to do 5-8km every jog, but I know that I really only want to do 3 or 4. So when I get to the end of what I want to do, I'm only halfway done and I've got to get back somehow. I'm not going to hitchhike and I didn't bring money for a bus, so I guess I'm running...or walking. It doesn't matter. Just put the miles behind you.",

I want to do the same this summer but am having problems of getting to the gym and staying consistent. Last year I was super consistent all summer doing PHUL and missed probably a maximum of 2-3 days for 3 months. This summer, things are different. I'm trying to stay consistent and want to have a productive summer, working out, working a job and just improving myself. I am a fairly conscientious person, meaning I get guilty when I'm being unproductive or not doing the things I should be doing. Right now, I get thoughts of not going to the gym and they stick, they are hard to get rid of and make me dread going to the gym. It's weird because I understand and know how good I feel after the gym, but I'm irrationally dreading going to the gym. I like my program (doing PHUL this summer again), my gym, and the time when I gym. But, I'm still getting thoughts of dread going to the gym, then feel guilty about it, because I'm not staying consistent when I want to. Trying to unplug my emotions and just getting to the gym hasn't worked that well, because I just think I'm lying to myself and there is a deeper issues at hand than some feelings taking over my thoughts. Any ideas or knowledge that would help me get out of this tough spot? Thanks.",

Ever since then I just stfu about my problems and complaints and go. It may not be what you want to hear but sometimes it's the cold hard truth, I didn't want to hear it and even got a little upset , but once it hit me , it just made going to the gym.",

I am 6'3\" 29M, 210 lbs. My last tested squat 1RM is 375 lbs but it is probably closer to 405 now. My bench is lagging with a 245 lbs 1RM. It took me 9 months of training to go from hitting 405x5 for the first time to hitting 500 lbs. After I hit 405 I went on a cut and lost some strenh, but then in about August I started cultivating mass again and really set my sights on 500. I told myself that I would bulk for as long as it took to hit my goal, and as added motivation I made a friendly bet with my friends that I could hit before they hit their arbitrary fitness goals (a 3:43 marathon and a 5 minute mile, respectively). I am happy to say that I won! During my cut after hitting 405 I was running PHAT, and then at some point around when I switched to a bulk I began running PHUL. I didn't really like PHUL as much except that I liked 4 workouts a week much more than 5. So about 6 weeks ago I which is essentially a 4 day body part split focusing on one compound lift per day. For deadlifts I would pull heavy triples for three weeks in a row and then attempt a 1RM. I hit 435, 465, 485 easily doing that, but I had more trouble getting over the hump to 500. That is likely due to me trying to rush it with the birth of my daughter being imminent - I attempted and failed 500 two weeks in a row before getting it yesterday. Oh, and it felt so easy I hit a Let me know if you have any questions about deadlift progression.",

    "title:": "Meditation is actually a lot like lifting and can add a lot to a fitness regime - allow me to explain",
    "text": " So I've been going to the gym for the last couple years - with no real discipline if I'm going to be honest, but I'm not too worried about bulking up or anything - rather, I do it for my mental health. I've been struggling with depressive tendencies for as long as I can remember, and if there's something I've noticed about working out with weights it's that the whole exercise is, in fact, almost entirely mental. The body can always do a lot more than you think it can, and the trick to a really good workout is getting into the right mindset - the hardest thing about lifting with depression is that you're really lifting two things. So to this end I've been getting into meditation recently - it comes highly recommended from just about any source on mental wellbeing you care to mention and sits next to antidepressants and CBT as one of the most effective treatments for depression currently known. The interesting thing, however, is that a meditative exercise is actually a lot like lifting. To demonstrate, I want to share with you all an exercise I recently did with a group here at the London Buddhist Centre called \"Mindfulness of Breathing\" - don't worry too much about the Buddhism or the buzzwords - just because something good happens to have come from a religion doesn't mean it's a religious practice (indeed, after all, did we not get Modern Science from the Muslims?). Try this exercise once a day - before you go to sleep, and you'll sleep better; instead of drinking or smoking and it will help you cut down drinking and smoking; more generally, it will train your mind, giving you greater control of your thoughts, the way training your muscles gives you greater control of your body. All of these factors (sleep, drugs, mindset), as you already know, contribute to making a fitness regime more effective. Let's Begin First up you need to find a suitable place to do this - you want as little distraction as possible, quiet and dimly lit, with a chair or a soft floor/mattress against a wall. The position in which you do this is everything: sitting (NOT LYING) with your back straight and your butt flat on something - the best way to do it is in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, but I usually do this on my bed with my back against the wall and my legs loosely crossed with as little weight sitting on my feet as possible - with a small cushion in the small of your back (not essential but I find it makes it easier to keep my back straight) and under your butt if you so desire. The easiest way to find out how you should be sitting is to slip your hands under your butt and find the two little bony bumps near the tops of your legs. These are your \"sit bones\" (tuber ischiadicum) and as you rock your upper body back and forth you'll feel them press more or less firmly into your hands. You want these to be as firmly in contact with your seat as possible, so wherever you feel them pressing hardest into your hands, that's how you should sit. Now take your hands out from under your butt and put them in your lap. It doesn't matter where they are as long as they're still and comfortable - I usually hold them close to my belly, palms up, one inside the other, but they can literally be any way you want them to be, fingers entwined, palms down, one hand on each leg, wherever feels most natural. Finally, close your eyes. Warm Up First thing you're going to need to do is take two deep breaths. Breathe in as deep as you can, hold it, breathe out. Repeat. Simple, and vital. This is analogous to stretching before you work out - it eliminates the initial tension (stiffness) that will hold you back for the rest of the exercise if you don't do it. Now we're going to do a \"body scan\" - this is akin to warming up - again, you can skip it if you really want to, but it will make the rest of the exercise a lot easier - this process will simultaneously relax your body and bring your mind into the particular mode/state which makes meditation possible. A body scan goes like this: 1. Focus on the sensation in your toes. What do you feel? Perhaps you can feel your socks, the hair on top of your toes, maybe a bit of tingling, the skin of your toes against each other. Focus on this and nothing else. Notice what you feel - don't try to put it into words, don't try to change how it feels, just try to notice. 2. Focus on the tops and bottoms of your feet. Same thing - what do you feel? Maybe there's a subtle ache from walking around through the day, some heat. Be receptive. If your feet are flat on the floor pay especial attention to the horizontal surface-to-surface sensation - this is your connection back to the ground, your solidity, your base, and there is a lot of strenh here for the mind. 3. Heels and ankles, same thing. 4. Calves - carry a lot of tension - just feel it, don't try to relax necessarily - the attention itself will do the relaxing for you - tension is a very unconscious thing. 5. Shins - maybe you can feel the material of your clothing - if indeed you feel nothing, focus on the lack of sensation itself, the negativity, the absence. It's a curious feeling, isn't it? It's rather strange when you actually notice it. 6. Knees - and don't forget the backs of your knees either. 7. Thighs - front and back, and as you go up toward your butt you're likely to feel a lot of tension here too (women especially carry a lot of tension in the buttocks) - feel the buttocks flat on the horizontal surface - again, here is your connection back to the base - feel your body heavy on this solidity, almost like you're a part of it (which you are). 8. Lower back, and from here up the spine - this is the hardest part of the scan - feel the muscles radiating out of your spine - feel the spine extending all the way from the seat up to the back of the head - it's long It's really long, and a lot of your muscles connect directly to it - feel all the aches and strains in your back as your focus moves upward (as slowly as it needs to) and outward to your shoulders. 9. Down the arms - from the shoulders through the triceps and biceps, the elbows, the forearms and wrists - try to feel each of these muscles individually (a mental ability which, by the by, comes in very handy in the middle of a lift - if you can feel where in your body the lift is actually happening you're more likely to know if you're doing it as you intend it, and to shift the weight accordingly) and the skin on them - linger as long as you need to to register some kind of sensation, whatever it is. 10. The hands - like the feet these are complex systems and require some time on their own - the tops and palms of your hands first. 11. The fingers - whatever your hands are touching, you'll feel it most in your fingers - there is a lot of sensation here, so take the time to feel each finger individually, the touch of the fingers against each other and against the surface on which they're rested. 12. Your belly and chest - there tends to be a knot of tension somewhere in this area - linger on it and feel it ever so slowly loosening - feel your ribs as they move, little by little, inward and outward with your breath - feel your diaphragm expand and contract - feel the tension under your armpits which spreads all the way back to your spine. 13. Your neck - like your hands and your feet, your head is a complex area with a lot of muscles and a lot of sensation - and, perhaps more importantly, a LOT of tension - so we're going to do each individual little bit separately - feeel the muscles in your neck radiating toward your chest, your shoulders, your upper back. 14. The back of your head and your ears - move your focus slowly up in a band around the back of your head and to the crown - you should be able to feel all the hair on your head (or skin if you've got no hair) - it might help to imagine what it would feel like to be massaged in this area. 15. Your forehead - lots of tension here - from the hairline down to the eyebrows. 16. The orbits and cheeks - ditto - linger as you need to. 17. The nose and lips - you'd be surprised how much tension there is in the top lip and the little bit between your lips and your nose - feel it, let yourself feel it all. 18. The jaw - this is the most tense part of most people's bodies - the ideal for meditation is that the jaw should be just slack enough that your teeth aren't touching - this is harder than it sounds. Easy, right? Now do this twice more. Try to feel each of these parts of your body relax progressively as you repeat the process. It can help to imagine light moving up and over your body as you do this, especially if you imagine this light comes from your belly - a warm, golden orange light - starting as a little ball in your solar plexus/sacrum and expanding out into a ring, then moving down to wrap in around your toes, before proceeding upwards as above. The Lifts To recap, you've done 2 x deep breaths + 3 x body scans. You will now do four exercises, analogous for our purposes to lifts - and each will involve a number of sets of ten reps - literally. The aim of these exercises is to focus on your breath. You want to be intensely aware of the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body and the way your body reacts to the air as it comes in, moves about, and then exits - and then, most importantly, that very still period between the breaths when your body is empty. Ultimately you should feel your breath in your whole body - this is why we do the body scan first, so as to bring the sensation of your body to the fore in your mind. During this time you're going to notice thoughts coming into your consciousness. This is where \"meditation\" properly speaking happens - the aim is to bring your focus deliberately back to the breath. Make no mistake: you're not trying to suppress your thoughts - rather, what you're trying to do is recognise your thoughts as thoughts (instead of as facts or realities) - these are mental phenomena, and (so the story goes) you do, in fact, have the freedom (if you train yourself) to choose how you respond to their presence in your life. Every thought process is a train, and your consciousness is a train station - when the train pulls up to the station, you decide whether or not to get on. Much of life's happiness involves getting caught up in a thought train (read up on Flow Psychology for more info) but for the purposes of meditation your aim is not to get onto any of these trains. This is harder than it sounds - much harder - that's why you train. For the first two exercises (or lifts) we are going to count the reps - 1 to 10 - for one reason and one reason only: the moment you realise you've lost count or stopped counting, that's when you know your attention has deviated - bring your attention back to the breath and start again from 1. Don't be discouraged when this happens - on the contrary, take joy in these moments, for each of these is a little triumph - you'll notice it feels almost kind of uncomfortable to do this deliberate focussing of the attention - this discomfort is analogous to the burn - and indeed when meditation is difficult (like lifting, sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's hard) you will have to dig to bring the attention back to the breath. How to breathe? Naturally. Don't try to breathe slowly, don't try to hold the breath, just let yourself breathe - indeed what you want to do is notice - the whole aim of meditation is to notice, to watch your body react, to watch with curiosity and receptivity - notice how the breath changes, how the state of the body changes as you breathe and as your breath changes - you might feel your heart beating, you might feel your body temperature dropping - let all of this sensation become as bright and intense as possible - and indeed it can get very intense, sometimes overwhelming - stick with it, try to focus on the positive feelings you have. Focus always on the breath: the life-giving breath. Imagine the air is fresh and imbuing your body with energy - because, of course, as you'll already know from your reading on fitness, this is in fact what is actually happening. Oxygen is entering your red blood cells, which produce adenosine triphosphate or ATP, whose responsibility it is to transfer the caloric value of whatever nutritional intake you've provided for yourself to the rest of your body - your muscles, your organs, your brain. Remember: there are people in this world who live on 500 calories a day or less - for example, Buddhist monks, whose entire caloric intake is determined by what they can beg - and live to old age in great health. It's the breath that you need before you need anything else: whatever life throws at you, if you can breathe with it, you can be with it. Meditation makes you a hardier person - this is why we do it. Enough talk Let's do it: 1. First you're going to focus your attention on the little infinitesimal moment at the end of the exhale - as soon as you notice the breath stop moving, say to yourself in your mind: \"1\" - repeat, and this time, as soon as you notice the air stop moving: \"2\" - and so on and so forth. You're going to do three sets of ten reps for the first few weeks of your meditation - as you continue and develop, the time it takes for the distraction to happen grows, and the number of sets increases. 2. Same thing again, but this time you're going to focus on the moment the breath starts - the tiny infinitesimal moment just before you inhale - and as soon as you feel the air start to move, say to yourself in your mind: \"1\" - repeat, and this time, as soon as you notice the air start to move: \"2\" - and so on up to \"10\" before beginning again at \"1\" - repeat this three times. 3. At this point you're going to stop counting - but always remember, as soon as you notice yourself getting on a thought train, get off, and get back to the breath. In this exercise you are going to focus on the breath as a whole. The breath is a process - it involves your whole body and it moves in a cycle from beginning to end - feel the breath move through you, feel your body respond to the breath. 4. Finally, you are going to focus - again, without counting - on just the place where you first feel the breath. This might be at the end of your nose, where you feel the cool air entering your nostrils; it might be your belly, where you feel your diaphragm drop; it might be your rib cage, where you feel your lungs expanding. These sensations all happen simultaneously, so which one you feel first will change each time you do this meditation, but for each individual meditation pick a spot and stick to it. Do this for as long as you can bear it, always looking out for thought trains. This should be the longest part of the meditation. Finally, cool down - all you need to do is sit, and relinquish control of your thought. Just be still for a moment. Slowly let your eyes open. Notice the room around you. Notice where your thoughts want to go. Let them go. Slowly start moving. Stand up. Stretch. Go forth. Be prosperous. Best of luck all.",

I do a beginner program there times a week and cardio the other three days. I'm looking to cut and get a somewhat decent physique but I would like to reach the 1,000 pound club. Is that a reasonable goal for someone who is not a hardcore lifter and a little more casual? Thanks!",

    "title:": "Cutting Fat? Cut the Sugar.",
    "text": " Sugar and fiber have contrasting roles in food. Simple sugars are rapidly absorbed from the digestive tract raising blood sugar abruptly. Fiber slows the absorption of sugars slowing the rate of blood sugar rise. In a state where the body needs a lot of energy quickly, a rapid blood sugar rise will be controlled by rapid cell use of the energy. However, when overall energy supply is high and utilization is low as with the current US lifestyle and diet, the blood sugar is not needed for energy as fast as it is being absorbed. The blood sugar is then converted to the fat triglyceride in the liver. Once converted these triglycerides are put into the circulation to be delivered to fat tissue for storage. Fat production and storage is as much related to the pace at which sugars are absorbed as it is the overall amount in a given meal. This is where fiber is supposed to come in. When adequate natural fiber exists in the meal slowing the absorption of sugars, the blood sugar rise is spread over a longer time interval allowing cell energy usage to keep up with energy intake. The net result is that little or none should be converted to fat. Two foods can be eaten with the identical calories and grams of sugar, yet they result in very different patterns of energy usage versus fat production. Slowly absorbed carbohydrate is termed “low glycemic” load, while quickly absorbed carbohydrate is termed “high glycemic load”. The high-glycemic meal results in a rapid blood sugar rise in the first hour which results in a high insulin output to lower blood sugar. As the cell requirements are not this great in the first hour, much of that sugar is sent to the liver and converted to triglyceride for fat storage. This happens aggressively in the presence of high insulin resulting in the blood sugar dropping back to the fasting level in just a little over 2 hours. This triggers hunger and thus a desire to eat again sooner. The low glycemic load meal can contain the same calories and grams of carbohydrate but in a slowly digestible form. The result is a very gradual blood sugar rise, much lower insulin output and complete use of the sugars for energy rather than for triglyceride production. The gradual absorption of sugars over 4 hours sustaining energy levels suppresses the hunger response for a much longer interval. Remember, these two meals contain the exact same carbohydrate grams and calories, yet they have much different effects on fat production and hunger response. Given this dynamic, what determines and controls the glycemic load of different carbohydrates is important. The simplest and most useful marker is the sugar to fiber ratio. Remarkably, a good whole food, low glycemic load diet has about a 1:1 sugar to fiber ratio. The current U.S. average is about 12:1. This is the result of both adding sugar to just about all manufactured foods and the removal of fiber during processing. The 1:1 ratio in a whole food diet comes from about 50 grams of natural sugars per day and about 45 grams of natural fiber. The average daily intake of fiber in the U.S. is about 12-15 grams, while the average sugar intake is 180-220 grams. Why would we be refining fiber out and adding huge amounts of sugar to almost everything when it has important adverse health effects? Sugar drives consumption and fiber drives satiety or the signal “I have had enough”. A high sugar to fiber ratio artificially manipulated in food gets us to consume and therefore buy more food.",

I've been chasing this goal for 3 years, ever since Kalle Beck threw it down in Starting Strongman. At the time, I could manage 7 reps, and I assumed it was right around the corner. However, I got big into competing in strongman, so my strict press got deprioritized and then I blew out my ACL, so training got a little different.

I was inspired by videos on Youtube (especially the transformations) and certain content creators (David Laid), who I believe turned me from not knowing the difference between a barbell and dumbbell to helping me correct and improve my lifts. I did a decent amount of research before starting the gym. Learning that a beginner can gain both muscle and lose fat simultaneously, which seemed impossible. A few of my friends who went to the gym before me were all on a bro split (chest,arms,shoulders,leg,back) etc. But I decided to be different and picked up the PPL split immediately upon entering the gym. For the first few weeks I was learning and trying to perfect the movements, then I started progressive overload. After 6 or so months going from 132lbs to 150lbs I hit a plateau and wasn't progressing anymore. I couldn't notice any physique changes or noticeable strenh gains. My Bench went from 135lbs to 170lbs, deadlift 198lbs to 275lbs, squat 165lbs to 225lbs (1rm's). So after losing a bit of motivation and no progress for a while, I decided to track the calories I was eating on myFitnessPal. So for the past 3 months I've been making sure I get atleast 3100 calories daily which has massively improved not only my strenh but my physique. From month 7 to 10 I've been able to gain a further 15 or so pounds of weight. My strenh also increased quite significantly: Bench: 135 to150 to now 225 Deadlift: 198 to 275 to now 352 Squat: 165 to 225 to now 270 &x200B; Suppluments: Creatine monohydrate and Whey protein",

    "title:": "125 lbs. - 191 lbs. Two year journey of a recovering addict",
    "text": " As the result of a bad habit I picked up and an incredibly long series of bad decisions, I dropped down from around 160 pounds to an emaciated 125 pounds at the height of 5'9 and at the age of 18 years old. After a stint in rehab and some serious self-reevaluation, I decided it was important that I put as much effort into my physical health as my mental health. I started hitting the weights, not following any program, or tracking my progress at all. My 1 rep max on the bench was 95 pounds when I first began my journey. Same number for squat, and I didn't even know what a dead lift was at the time. I rose back to around 150ish with this \"program\" where I would basically just use whatever machine in the gym I felt like using at the time, and an absolutely trash diet. I wasn't getting much stronger, and I wasn't looking any stronger either. I actually ended up relapsing and going on a bender, dropping back down to 140ish pounds and ultimately ending up in the hospital. It was after I got out of the hospital that I decided that I was going to be serious about getting in shape. I think that was the last push I needed to snap out of my jaded mental state. I started slowly cleaning up my diet. Every week I would take something out of the equation and replace it with a healthier alternative. I started doing more research on what I should be doing in the weight room, and what would actually push me outside of my comfort zone and make me stronger. And I began to see results. After I started seeing noticeable differences, it only motivated me more. I was getting stronger, and honestly, it was pretty exciting. Somewhere in the process, it stopped becoming a chore, and I started to \"embrace the grind\". After every workout it seemed like the only thing I could think about was adding more weight to the bar next time. Eventually I hit , which was my original goal weight. My numbers only climbed, and I found that discipline in the weight room started translating into discipline in other areas of my life as well. Thoughts of relapsing went away, I was no longer fueling my body with trash. It's hard to explain, but I guess I just felt much healthier. I walk around at around nowadays. I feel stronger than ever, healthier than ever, and even my life outside the gym seems to be falling into place. A few more pics at my current weight As dumb as it may sound, the weight room has changed my life, my outlook, almost everything. At the risk of looking like an idiot, I felt it was important to share my story. It keeps me motivated and maybe, just maybe it would help someone out or motivate them as well. Because people have asked, I'm currently running a PPL split and trying to cut down body fat. I stick to compound lifts with all accessory exercises being done to drop sets. I still haven't followed any specific programs such as 5x5 or 5/3/1, but I am definitely going to consider it once I slim down a bit Cheers guys and gals.",

Yeah nothing special, there are plenty of people who run marathons in this sub at the pace he ran them, but what intrigued me was that he definitely could’ve passed for an amateur bodybuilder Typically, not always but from what I’ve seen, long distance runners are for sure more on the skinny side.

The bench seems to be the lift that the most people struggle with; I sent out a survey last year asking people which lift they had the most trouble with (out of the squat, bench, and deadlift), and almost 2/3 said they had the most issues with the bench. With that in mind, I think a lot of people will benefit from this guide. I'm pretty sure it's the most thorough resource for the bench press out there. Be warned: it's quite long (94 pages in a Word doc) and it can be fairly dense and technical at times, but most of the more technical points have pictures or graphics to illustrate them, and I'll be around to answer questions if there's any confusion. It would obviously be hard to summarize the whole thing, but topics discussed include the nuts and bolts on a physics/biomechanics level, how to create a safe and stable setup, troubleshooting the lift for your unique leverages, how to use leg drive and optimize bar path, and a pretty extensive FAQ of common issues people face in the bench press.

I used to think it was a result of poor training and commitment, but now I actually believe it's a result of improper expectations. They believe they are WAY closer to their ideal body than they really are, and so they set an expectation of \"I'll be fit in a couple months\" and feel like failures when they're not.",

    "text": " Hey /r/fitness, many of you may recognize my that I've shared before, but it's another year and another cutting cycle down and I thought I'd update you all on my progress. After losing the 28 lbs you see in the previous picture, I spent the next 8 months in a maintenance/lean bulk phase. After regaining 12 lbs, in January I decided it was time to cut again. For this cut I decided not to use keto again, despite having great results with it last year. I made this decision mostly out of convenience, as my job requires me to be away all day and I often eat dinner in my car, so keeping meat or eggs in my car all day was not an option for me. I tracked calories meticulously and used a 2pm-8pm eating window (intermittent fasting) which I had great success with in the past. A day of eating would usually consist of 2 meals at about 1000 calories per meal. An example: Meal 1: 2 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a banana or two a Clif energy bar or oats Meal 2: Chicken and veggies (sometimes on tacos, sometimes not) 2 servings of protein powder 8 oz skim milk This usually would give me around 1900-2100 calories, with roughly 160-170g of protein. As for training, I followed . In December (before the cut) my lifts at a mock powerlifting meet were 375lb squat/205lb bench (kind of a fluke, though)/455 deadlift. I'd love to give you my list of excuses why my bench was so terrible, but I'll spare you and just say that in the gym I've hit a 240lb bench. My strenh over the past year hasn't increased much, and that's due a lot to me dedicating a lot of energy into bouldering, which is a hobby I picked up shortly after my diet last year. Those sessions can leave my shoulders and back pretty tired, and my strenh training has somewhat suffered from this, but I don't mind too much as I've become pretty happy with where my strenh is at. Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope to keep you all updated with my future goals!",

    "text": " What my question is exactly is difficult to explain but I will do my best. I played competitive water polo for a long time, and during conditioning, we would do training drills to increase our ability to hold our breath. Things like hypoxic breathing sets, underwater laps, etc. Now, I understand why this was something we trained to do. One reason being when you swim, you go faster the less you breathe and lift your head to take breaths. Also, it was great conditioning as it was much more tiring to do laps and sprints while you were more out of breath. My question is, now that I’m not a competitive swimmer /water polo player, would breath training and similar drills be effective and beneficial still. I know they’d help my overall conditioning. But aside from just being more tired when I hold my breath when I swim, what could other benefits be? Is putting your body at an oxygen deficit for reasonably short periods of time beneficial in any way? I can easily swim a 25 yard lap under water still even though it’s been years since I had to do it for training. And I find it relaxing when I do hop in a pool for a workout. But are there benefits I could still see if I’m not necessarily focused on doing it to be faster as a swimmer or a better conditioned swimmer?",

    "text": " Hello all, For a couple of years, I have been weight training using the PPL program, where each muscle group gets stimulated twice per week. Although I've obviously seen and felt great progress over this span of time, I always felt as though I was taxing my body and hindering my recovery. I was getting stronger and more muscular, but progress was incredibly slow. My strenh would stall for up to a month at times, and it would take every ounce of effort just to get that additional rep to ensure \"progressive overload.\" I kept my sets at 8 per muscle group per session, totaling 16 sets for each muscle at week's end. However, ever since I switched over to the Bro Split, I always come back into the gym feeling more than ready. To my pleasant surprise, my strenh is climbing faster than ever before. I'm able to get an additional 2-3 reps per week using the same heavy weights that I'd otherwise be stalled on using PPL.This newfound and superior progress is keeping me motivated. I'm currently doing between 12-16 intense sets for each muscle group once a week. I don't understand why the Bro Split gets so much hate. People act as if it's the worst program a lifter could utilize to better themselves. Could this be an individualistic thing? Thanks for any input.",

    "title:": "How to murder your biceps, especially if you are tall.",
    "text": " The problem: Biceps (brachii) used to be a tricky muscle group for me to work. I had a poor mind-muscle connection and I had a hard time really working the biceps effectively. I would feel soreness in my forearm flexors and deltoids and to a lesser extent the long head of my biceps, but I couldn't really build the biceps muscle itself, especially the short head that makes up the thick inner portion- the \"peak\" of the muscle that shows when you fully flex the muscle. I've learned that basically what was happening is that my forearm flexors, specifically the brachialis and brachioradialis were doing the bulk of the work in my \"biceps\" workout. This make sense because their job is to flex the elbow and they insert much lower on the arm than the biceps, so they are able to perform elbow flexion more efficiently than the biceps. Normally I am not a fan of arbitrary supersets for different muscle groups. A lot of people do multiple exercises for the same muscle group simply because different must be better. In some cases this is true, as you can work different aspects of the muscle group especially if they perform multiple functions. For instance, the triceps not only extend the elbow but they also help extend the shoulder joint in the sagittal plane. Thus to work the whole triceps you need to do both. For instance, doing regular tricep pressdowns as well as straight-arm pressdowns (doing this on a lat-pull machine is heavenly.) The solution: I've devised the following superset with the goal of pre-exhausting the forearms flexors before working the biceps themselves, particularly the short head. The exercises, performed in order and without rest, are: 1. You can also do regular hammer curls but I feel using the rope attachment with a pulley is superior. Perform with a weight that will get you to muscle failure in 8-15 reps. Do a few cheat reps at the end where you really focus on the top (fully contracted) position of the exercise. This should completely fatigue your brachioradialis because when your hands are in a neutral position (thumbs pointing up, palms facing together) the BR is dominant in elbow flexion. 2. Grip the bar with palms down and thumbs on the underside of the bar. This position will maximize the role of the brachialis, completely neutralize the short head of the biceps, and greatly weaken the BR and biceps long head. I recommend bringing your elbows backwards slightly so that you can get maximum load in the fully contracted position. Again, perform to failure including some cheat reps. We want the forearms flexors to be massacred before our biceps works. 3. Use a LIGHT dumbbell, probably 50% or even less of the weight you typically use when you perform your regular, bouncy, worthless bro curls. I am 225 lbs and can bullshit curl 40lbs dumbbells all day but I use 15lbs for my concentration curls. You can perform these seated or in a standing/bent over sort of position. The key word here is supination. Supination is what you are doing when you turn your hands from palms-down to palms-up. The majority of weight should thus rest on the fat part of your outer palm. We do this because the short head of the biceps is primarily responsible for supination. Your elbow should be down so that the area just above the elbow is resting against the inside of your knee/thigh. Your forearm should basically be pointed across the gap between your legs. Curl the weight up. When you reach the top the head of the dumbbell nearest to your body should touch somewhere on your chest. Squeeze, motherfucker, squeeze. Pretend that you are trying to rotate that dumbbell through your weak, pathetic chest. Squeeze. Prepare to feel your short biceps head spring to life. 4. Cry. Repeat for 3-5 sets. You can swap the order of 1 and 2. I'm experimenting to find if one is superior or not. However 3 must be performed last. I highly recommend using a pulley, ez curl bar, and dumbbell because you can put them all out in front of you and perform exercises rapidly without having to change attachments or hog the curl bar rack.

      "This is a very good idea. the \"peak\" of the muscle that shows when you fully flex the muscle.",
      "The secret to building biceps is lower the weight by a third of whatever you think you should be doing. Use the 4/2 method, 2 seconds on the lift and 4 seconds on the negative to really carve it out. With arms bi's/tr's the secret is to really try and dial in your form, isolate the muscle and make it do all the work.",
      "All good tips man. I've learned that basically what was happening is that my forearm flexors, specifically the brachialis and brachioradialis were doing the bulk of the work in my \"biceps\" workout.",
      "Your brachialis is the first muscle activated in elbow flexion and is strong enough for unloaded. As soon as you add weight, it is pretty useless and your biceps brachii does most of the work. Brachioradialis is one of the last used in the 'chain'.",
      "This make sense because their job is to flex the elbow and they insert much lower on the arm than the biceps, so they are able to perform elbow flexion more efficiently than the biceps.",
      "I don't tend to do a lot of isolated curl moves, as I prefer doing rows and pullups, so I tend to have underdeveloped biceps compared to my brachiallis, so this is a way to counteract this effect that works for me. I also find this to be especially effective when I'm doing curls after pullups/rows, as my fatigued brachiallis prevents me from really working my biceps.",
      "Normally I am not a fan of arbitrary supersets for different muscle groups.",
      "You were exhausting your forearms without adequately working your biceps. The only real thing you improved with your new solution is adding a more focused biceps workout which could just as easily be added to your original workout.",
      "I simply can't help it. A lot of people do multiple exercises for the same muscle group simply because different must be better.",
      "Shit I have 18\" arms and I only do 4-5 sets of curls a week thats it. The key is the heavy compound pull movements.",
      "In some cases this is true, as you can work different aspects of the muscle group especially if they perform multiple functions.",
      "People typically pre-exhaust the muscle group that fails last - in this case your biceps - so that in later exercises all muscle groups fail at the same time. So, it doesn't make sense to me that you're focusing on biceps in your final exercise.",
      "The flexers take over in most regular curls. For instance, the triceps not only extend the elbow but they also help extend the shoulder joint in the sagittal plane.",
      "Brachioradialis is one of the last used in the 'chain' I suppose you could say to be used. Look at spurt vs shunt muscles.",
      "I'll look up spurt/shunt."

      "The best cue I got was to breathe in and brace on the rollout and then drive your knees into the ground on the rollback. It took a while before I felt anything in my abs at all. Now when I do rollouts I can feel my abs contacting -hard!",
      "Tight hip flexor/ inguinal hernia. By activating I mean feeling my abs flex and stretch throughout the movement.. However, if I do brace before rolling out, then as I come back up it's much harder for me to feel that \"squeeze\" or activation in my abs.",
      "My trainer says ab wheels are silly, you can work abs in so many other better ways,.",
      "So is bracing taking away the effectiveness of the exercise?. Is not bracing before every rep on the ab wheel a recipe for injury?",
      "I always thought the point of this type of exercise was to be braced and then move through a rangebof motion that requires you to strain to maintain that core brace. Not so much like a crunch where you are actively using and then relaxing the muscles but more similar to a sustained isometric hold."

I'm specifically wondering if you think tonal can be used to build muscle since it's method of resistance is different from free weights and more similar to cables or resistance bands. The features seem pretty cool, specifically the chains and eccentric mode which apply add and reduce weight as during concentric and eccentric phases of the reps which I felt were better than free weights.
