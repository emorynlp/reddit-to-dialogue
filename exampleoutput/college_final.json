    "text": " I'm an instructor, and I give students two weeks to submit a lab that takes about an hour. Unsurprisingly, about 75% of students submit their work on the last day, and about 50% in the last hour. What did surprise me is that nearly 50% of the students didn't even look at the instructions until the final day. They're not waiting till the last minute to finish, they're waiting till the last minute to start. I offer lots of assistance - live help sessions, video instructions, discussion forums, email, etc - but I can't help students who start their work on the last day after I've already gone to bed. Last-minute students - is there anything your instructors can do to help you? Or is this a lost cause? UPDATE: Thank you all for your thoughtful feedback. I knew that students lived a stressful life, but I didn't realize just how bad it is. You have my sympathy For what it's worth, I've observed the same behaviour in traditional, in-person labs. We had a lab that used to be two hours long, and students would just barely get it done in time. We expanded the lab to three hours, without changing any of the content. Students still barely got it done in time. I'd wager that I could make the same lab 1 hour or 4 hours, and nothing would change. Whenever you give a deadline, students will just barely meet it. This is why I'm wary of suggestions to break a lab into pieces, each with their own deadline. If students are struggling to meet one deadline, then making them meet three deadlines doesn't help. Good luck in your studies Start early!",

If a lot of students are struggling with it and turning it in last minute, you can always send out an email saying your willing to help, but they have to come to office hours at xyz time.

      "Not even reading the instructions until the final day sounds a bit extreme though. You might be dealing with a special breed of procrastinators.

Even though it might look like the assistance and effort you're putting into this is worthless, you do have a few students who really appreciate all of your efforts. My suggestion is to not cut back on what you've been offering, and maybe make it clear in class that they need to read the assignments BEFORE the due date, and that you will (most likely) NOT answer emails after on the due date (or whatever time sounds reasonable.).",

      "In your situation, if I was your student and I knew I had a lab due that would only take about an hour, it would be pretty low on my priority list until the day that it was due. Generally once I get an idea of how long a homework will take for a class, I try to budget my time with other assignments so that I know I’ll have time for it, while still making sure that other things that are due first are done first.",
      "Knowing that I have a couple assignments that I can safely and easily work on a day before or on the due date eases some of that stress for me. You said that the lab takes about an hour. They may recognize a pattern if all your past labs have also taken about an hour to complete.",
      "If your students are able to turn things in early that certainly helps because if I were given an assignment on day x and couldn't turn it in until two weeks later then I wouldn't do it until two weeks later because even if I do it the night it is assigned I will forget to turn it in because my brain thinks I am done with it. When a deadline is coming up, many students, not just students with ADHD, will feel a sort of \"emergency response\" that gives them the energy/focus to get things done (The \"oh no it is 11:00 and my assignment is due at 11:59\" experience is way more powerful than most people care to admit).",

My Professor's words: \"Hi (redacted name) - sorry to hear about your positive results - i learned this past weekend that a good friend of mine, although I haven't seen him in several years, died from Covid - I'm guessing though that he was unvaccinated because no one could tell him what to do - so I guess no one will be telling him what to do any longer. But I digress\" &x200B; I understand I was talking about COVID, so there may have been a moment where he wanted to relate with his experience, grief, etc., but I feel in an email where I was explaining my sickness and trying to ask for an extension on time to do assignments, it was out of nowhere and unexpected. I also feel like his stance of his friend's vaccination status is inconsiderate and assumptive. I didn't see any benefit to this dialogue. &x200B; Should I report my concerns to the dean?

    "text": " I'm a student in the Foreign Language Specialized School, one of the most reputable high schools in Viet Nam with a pretty decent gpa of 8.1 during my 10th grade, 8.3 during my 11th and 9.5 to a possible 9.7 during my 12th grade (on 10-point scale). However, Viet Nam's high school only means upper secondary education, and if i were to also include my 9th grade's gpa (which was a bit horrendous) it would mean i had to include grades from my lower secondary school year. So do i have to include my 9th grade's gpa or can i skip it due to having experienced a different school system? I also worry about the US's practice of using weighted GPA, because we have no such policy in Viet Nam. So i am left not understanding whether it would be to my disadvantage that i could only use my unweighted gpa to add to my resume. Secondly, I've not many leadership positions for my extracurricular activities. I mostly take part in voluntary work surrounding environmental activism, and am facing a dilemma of whether to pay an exorbitant fee for an institution named Summit to take me in and give me a chance to take part in their events in a leading position, or whether that would just be too disingenuous and the good unis would see right through it. I heard that it might be better to keep up the narrative of the \"grass root volunteer\", but a lot of folk also press me to take on a leadership position if i want to have a tangible chance of scoring a seat in a nice US college. I do have 2 national awards from recognized academic competitions (both are for English), and am the captain of my high school's national English team; though i am unsure if my merits surrounding this particular subject would be consider competitive in a resume at the top schools. Thirdly, I don't think i fully grasp how reference letters work. Can i just ask anyone who's taught me anything to recommend me, or does it have to strictly be someone from my school? Because in all honesty, I always thought that it would be better if I could ask someone with a more prestigious academic background to vouch for me and my academic prowess. And last but not least, i heard that schools in the US, especially the cream of the crop, are making SATs completely optional. Should i take it as \"it's completely ok if you don't do it\" or as \"we say that but we'll shred your application if you're without a competitive score\"? It's sorta my dream to be in one of the Ivy league schools, so I think if it's completely improbable that i would be accepted in one of those places then i probably wouldn't go at all. Seeing how I'm completely unequipped to answer that question myself, I'm really hoping that some of you guys would have an idea of how competitive my resume is so far and can make a more educated guess whether or not I could land a seat in one of the Ivies. And if it's at all possible to make my CV more likely to catch the eye of a US admissions committee, then I'd love to hear your suggestions! P/s: I forgot to mention but i’ve also taken part in a city level short story writing comp, and wrote a small school play.",

    "text": " I will likely end up with around a cumulative 2.9 at the end of this semester and I feel like I've just screwed up my future. I'm a non premed bio major, but I hope to one day get a Phd so I'm still really motivated and want to achieve so much in life. However, even if I were to get all 4.0s from now on (which I won't if I'm going to be honest), I will end up with a gpa around 3.5, which will still not get me into grad school and I will likely not be finding any stable jobs in the future. So safe to say, I'm really worried. I had a really hard time adjusting to being oos at a huge state school that I have zero clue how I got into and genuinely don't believe I belong in anymore. (TW) I also really struggled heavily with my mental health and came close to wanting to take the easy way out twice last semester. Being relatively smart was really the only thing I had going for me in life, so when that piece of my identity was taken away, I just felt really empty. I genuinely felt like there was zero point to it all. I tried so hard and go so little in return. It got really tough at the end of each semester when everyone and their moms were yelling about their 4.0s and paid internships and I couldn't cheer about really anything. It sucked. Also, not only did I skip out on getting good grades, I also skipped out on making friends and joining orgs. I now wish I had that support system or retreat space more than ever. I might be more mad at myself for that than anything else tbh. I've never felt more alone even though I'm surrounded by 40,000 people. Anyways, hopefully next year goes better, but I feel like I missed my chance at everything.",

Im debating between taking something I’ve wanted to for quite a while (Spanish classes) vs something highly useful and also interesting.

I really love the language- a third of my playlist is in Spanish, some of my favorite movies and tv shows are in Spanish, and I love the various cultures that are associated with it. The only downside is that I do not like the way foreign languages are taught in college. They focus too much on technical stuff, grammar, and testing and you don’t really end up being able to speak the language that well. However, knowing myself, I know learning Spanish is not something I could do on my own, outside of class. So I’d have to power through college courses. On the other hand, I could take some very useful electives which are also somewhat interesting. I’m a math and statistics major hoping to get into machine learning and these electives include more coursework in CS (including Algorithms, Intro to Data Science, Machine Learning, etc) and some even more advanced math (including Rudin’s mathematical analysis, topology, and stochastic calculus). Besides, since I’m aiming for a PhD in statistics after I graduate then research roles, these would be very valuable. Any thoughts or tips on this? Btw, I’ll be taking some other electives out of pure interest as well so its not like I won’t get the chance to explore other interests.",

Everyones been super helpful and friendly. However, now that I'm realizing that this is really happening, I'm now dreading going. It's not super far from my hometown, but far enough that I'll be staying on campus. That's something I'd do no matter where I go. I definitely need out of this house and away from strict parents. But it feels lonely. I know I'll make friends but no one I know is going there, or even in the same city. The thought of going and living there with strangers makes me want to cry. And I'm also scared of and dreading the difficulty of the classes. I'm a great student and my grades have never wavered, but I'm still scared. I love the college and I felt comfy there, but I feel less comfy now that my fear is holding me back. What if I chose the wrong place? Is there any way i can relieve this? Do others feel this way beforehand? I'm feeling quite unhappy about this, and dont know what to do.",

I have done maybe 2% of it. I just can’t seem to get any of it done. I also have to work 10 hours tomorrow and I can’t call off since it’s an independent contract job, so I have nobody to cover for me. I know, logically, he was “just a cat” but he is the closest loved one I have ever lost. Would it be reasonable for me to ask for a short extension? The report itself is due a week from Monday, so I was thinking about just asking if I could turn in the pre-lab portion with the report. He’s a great professor and he very clearly likes me and I always get everything done on time and get good grades, but instead of feeling like I could let it go just this once, I feel like I’d be letting him down or losing his respect. I don’t know. I’m just so broken right now.",

    "text": " I am just not having a good time and I don’t know if I can do another semester of this again. I already failed a class I need for my major last sem and I might fail some more this sem. It’s not even that anything traumatic happened or that I have “real” problems, but I really have oatmeal for brains and I can’t explain why I’m such a potato all the time without it just sounding like I’m lazy. I feel bad because I do enjoy my courses but I can’t fully engage and get the most out of them like I want to. It feels like a waste, and I especially feel bad since my parents are paying for my education. I’m so privileged and have everything I could want, even taking a break is something that a lot of people can’t afford to do. I considered taking a break next sem, but since my major is in architecture I’m not sure if I’d have to take the whole year off with the way the studios work. I’m also worried that if I do take a break then I’ll end up wasting it and spending that time stewing at home all day in isolation. I mean I had a year of pandemic to get it together but I spent it all doing nothing. I think I should at least work but I don’t know if it’ll be much different from going to school. If I can’t even be a proper full time student in the sheltered bubble of academia then can I even be a competent person in the real world? I feel like I need to be doing something and maximizing any time I take off otherwise it’s a waste. I am on meds right now and looking for a new therapist because they left me, so I would hope that I would get better instead of worse. I’d have to put in a lot of work myself though, it’s not like I can quit school and hope to magically be cured in a semester or two. I don’t know if I can even do that much. It also doesn’t help that I’d have to stay with my parents, which was not a good experience over the pandemic and contributed a lot to my decline in mental health. When I go home I’m even worse than at college but I also feel bad for wasting my education like this. I just don’t really know what to do and it feels like if I talk about it with other people I’ll just get told to stop making excuses and to get it together already",

    "text": " I'm just back from studying with a friend, and she confided to me that she feels so lonely the last few months. We're third years in the same major. She told me how her best friend has a boyfriend now and they don't talk anymore, and how while she knows she has friends she still feels so disconnected from everyone. I shared my similar experience, that since moving out of my friends' apartment and my best friend dropped out of college I could go a full day without having an in person conversation with anyone, and I find myself frequently in my own company. As we got to sharing, we recanted how we each knew multiple people who were similarly lonely. We got to the point of realising that having friends does not prevent feeling alone, and that most people wish for more meaningful interaction in their daily lives but won't go about constructing it themselves. Is loneliness just a part of the college experience? What are your thoughts on this?",

    "title:": "My Advice: If you ever feel slow and dumb or are struggling in a class, focus on overcoming the difficulty instead of your intelligence and trust in that process",
    "text": " I mean my dad told me a story about when he was a student. He was in a spatial geometry class and he was the slowest one in the class. Everybody else seems to be much quicker then him. However, he never gave up and tried his best. He eventually overcame all difficulties and become even better at the subject then everybody else. I have a mental illness that causes me to constantly assess my intelligence and care too much about it, even if their's no evidence that I was struggling in any classes. I always think to the future about some difficult classes coming up and I'm worried I'm going to be the slowest and stupidest one in the class. I always have the tendency to put myself in the shoes of another (such as a mathematician) or to think myself in a certain situation (such as being in a programming class) and then always ending up forming the conclusion that I might be below average or stupid (even if I wasn't struggling in any classes this semester at all). I always think back to the one programming class in which I have to take as a accounting major that I struggled with more than others. I always go to my dad for advice when such thoughts pop up. My dad's advice is usually this, and I feel it helped alot. He taught me to focus on the effort, not your innate talent or intelligence. He said for me to be positive and ignore such thoughts and focus on what you're supposed to be doing. I feel that this helped alot. I mean programming is kinda my own fault as I didn't work hard enough to overcome it and focused more on intelligence instead. My dad taught me a story of how he's the slowest one at work (I'm not sure if he's making this up or not), he's a engineer. He said everybody is faster then he is at figuring stuff out, however he still didn't feel discouraged or give up (despite not being the sharpest knife in the drawer). Instead he used whatever cards that he's dealt to work hard to figure things out (even if it takes him longer) and asks other's for help when needed. Eventually he ends up performing equally as well or even better then the people that are supposedly smarter and quicker. The point of me telling everybody this is that if you ever feel that you're slow and dumb and aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, you shouldn't focus to much on the fact that you aren't naturally smart or as quick witted as some other people. Instead you should focus on trying to overcome the difficulty and believe in the fact that if you try hard enough and never give up, everything's eventually going to click. If you struggle with applying what you learned or with logical thinking, do more practice and eventually things would get easier. Remember their are people with good genes that don't make the best of their abilities simply because they're lazy and that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. If you're naturally smart, then great. But if you aren't, just trust in the process and not give up.",

I've ran out of a room crying once when everyone looked at me to answer a question in class. I wanted to change this about myself, so I went into college as a Communication major, marketing minor, joined a marketing club (now on the executive board), and got a job in hospitality and another job in sales. I have gotten a lot better EXCEPT for standing in front of an entire room of people looking at me while it's dead silent. Couple examples: 1. Gave a speech about boba tea in front of a class of about 30 students (could've been worse). Rambled for about 3 minutes about how a lot of people don't like it because of the sucking balls into your mouth part and the texture. Yea 2. Dad jokes. I wear glasses so I walked into a room to give a pitch and I said \"You know the great thing about being blind as a bat and having social anxiety? I can take my glasses off and it's like none of you are here\" and I took off my glasses and put them on the table and proceeded with my pitch. I used to blush when talking to anyone. Plus the usual sweats, shaking, stuttering, rambling, panic attacks.. But I have been forcing myself out of my comfort zone for about 3 years now (I'm currently a junior) and putting myself in leadership positions. If you want to make a healthy change about yourself, do it. Go out of your comfort zone. It's a whole change in mentality and change doesn't happen over night, so be patient with yourself too.",

    "text": " I'm a student at a university. On my second year. Going for two degrees. One a degree in creative writing, the other a degree in biology. All with a minor in Outdoor Adventure. This is the final term of my second year at my university, but basically my first (because of Covid and other factors). Also, I'm 26. It took me 6 years at my community college to finally figure out what I wanted to do and get accepted to a university. And, despite my previous 6 years at a Community College, intellectual, I'm not much better than when I graduated highschool. So, six years at a Community College, two years at my university, and still basically a freshman... Now, I have always loved school. And still do, but I feel way overloaded at the moment. Not just with school, but personal life aspects too. I have ADHD, which has always affected me in school (in some good ways actually, depending on the topic), I also have brain damage from when I was 16 which basically wiped my memory clean and I have had to relearn almost everything. And that by itself has been trouble. But, even worse, really the worst aspect of all I think, is a social anxiety disorder I gained as a consequence of my memory loss. Basically, I was embarrassed of not knowing elementary things in highschool that I learned to lie and pretend I knew. Which made it so much harder for me to relearn since everyone thought I already knew. And my fear of others judging my hidden lack of knowledge made me more and more anxious to a point where I am now with a social anxiety disorder. And with my lack of relearned knowledge it makes many of my classes more difficult. Now, I'm actually a quick learner, but with the anxiety around judgment and how far behind I am intellectually, all coupled with my ADHD, I feel I am learning almost nothing in my courses. Putting me farther and farther behind. Along with all this my family is currently going through some tough times too. And my distance from them and inability to help is heavy too. And I'm confident, if I was to take a year off school, I would be able to catch up with the information I have missed.",

I woke up and this one girl went off on me about how I’m rude, I need to leave the chat ect. I apologized and said I won’t do it again my bad. And she continued to go on later once few people joined back. After this matter is it still her business to go off and keep talking about it? UPDATE : She just tried throwing shots at me with another one of my “friends” in the comment section. I came off mute and said “it’s not ur fucking business, look btw sir I’m sorry for falling asleep it was uncalled for. I already just apologized to y’all earlier so quit (I was even going to email him!)

The rudeness to disrupt class to \"call you out\" is far above the rudeness of falling asleep. I do agree with the other comments though, best practice is to mute your mic unless you want to say something.",

      "Sorry about that. It could happen to anyone. I think the professor or whoever was moderating the zoom meeting should have muted the sound & video in the interest of everyone.",
      "Anyways during our 5 minute break (everyone turned the cams off, audio on).",
      "Yeah, it's really rude of you. Some professors aren't even savvy enough to know how to mute students. The amount of times people have been making sounds on Zoom while the professor is talking...",
      "lol true, however I did apologize and he was really cool about it. I woke up and this one girl went off on me about how I’m rude, I need to leave the chat ect.",
      "I could barely hear the prof despite being in the front, but it was worse when he snored. Anyway, she could have asked the prof to mute you if it was bad, but to continue talking in the chat after you apologize is pretty bitchy. This sounds super immature btw, ignore her next time if she makes snarky comments and mute you shit until the professor wants you to answer, or as needed.",
      "I apologized and said I won’t do it again my bad.",
      "As a fellow acting student, also struggling to stay awake in early morning zoom classes, I feel you! People need to be more understanding during this weird time. Your classmate was in the wrong.",
      "And she continued to go on later once few people joined back.",
      "They're overreacting but in general you should keep your mic muted unless you need to talk. That's just basic video conference ediquete.",
      "After this matter is it still her business to go off and keep talking about it?",
      "Yea. Sounds like they have a stick so far up their asses. 😂 Glad to see that online classes doesnt stop some people from being tryhards and teacher’s pets."

    "text": " So I am a violin performance major. Today I had my upper level jury, which is basically a jury on steroids. It's pretty much to see if you are ready to progress in your degree or if you need another semester of preparing for upper levels (or get kicked out of the program if you fail miserably). Music majors typically do it in their second year. Well, I had mine today, and I passed I have been SUPER worried about it for months, I even cried one time last semester over how nervous and intimidated I was by the whole thing. I'm not one who typically gets stage fright during a concert or recital, but I do get nervous when I am playing an audition or anything that involves judges (which I don't think is stage fright, rather just anxiety about being judged by a professional). And I knew I was 10000% capable of this and I wouldn't be in music school if I wasn't. But I was still worried, because of how high the stakes were. This wasn't just a normal jury where it's just about \"cool, you did a good job.\" This would determine my eligibility to go on in my degree. What if something went wrong the day of the jury? What if I didn't get enough sleep the night before and I didn't do as well as I could have? What if I just wasn't ready? Today as I walked in to do my performance, my heart was pounding and I felt a bit shaky. But I went in there, played my best, and as soon as they told me I passed I breathed a huge sigh of relief to have that all behind me and to have passed after all. Literal blood, sweat, and tears went into the preparation of this and I could not be more relieved.",

I keep hearing how people are complaining about how the government should forgive student loans, and that some people feel that they shouldn't be required to pay these student loans, and that the student loan companies are to blame. And I know this may be an unpopular opinion, but I call BS. First off, student loans are a terrible way to pay for college, I think we can all agree on that. But this doesn't mean that the Government should be working to forgive your debt. Why should they? You took out money to purchase a service from a business and you think you shouldn't be entitled to pay for it? That doesn't seem fair? Not only that but you want them to forgive your debt, effectively letting you get your degree for while while people who worked their asses off during college, to pay for college shouldn't get anything in return. This is dumb. Then we have the argument of that student loan companies are to blame, how? You signed a contract to pay off those loans. Why is it that an 18 year old is responsible enough to sign an apartment lease and live on their own, but they should be accountable for signing out a student loan, just because they didn't fully understand a contract? Finally, we have the argument of people not being able to find a job because of their major, or the economy. No one forced you to major in something that isn't profitable. I don't care if you're passionate about political science, or communication if you aren't going to be able to get a decent paying job after college with that major pick something else, or at least double major, especially since you are taking out loans for it. I just had this long debate with a liberal arts major who is adamant that she shouldn't be forced to pay her loans because she still can't find a decent job. Thoughts?",

It was really helpful and all of my teachers were amazing, but I later realized that I wasn't learning things like the other normal classes were. Throughout my entire high school year I felt as though I hadn't learned enough in my classes. As I was finishing senior year, I had only gotten the begginer classes finished while other kids my age in normal classes were on higher level classes. For example, when I was finished with senior year, I had only completed algebra 1 and geometry 1, while normal classes would be finishing up with algebra 3 and geometry 2 or something. I am completely unsure how I was even able to graduate, since I don't recall doing good on the final tests, but I feel as though my IEP status pitied me and gave me a diploma just for trying. I never had good communication with my school since I was in that program, and everything paperwork wise was done for me, so I don't know a thing about school and where to even start. But it's always been a dream of mine to go to college. I'm 21 now and I didn't think I'd be able to go to college since I didn't learn much in school, but I'm really starting to regret it. I don't think I'd be accepted into any college with 9th grade level knowledge, and even if I was, I don't know where or how I'd even start. Does anyone have any tips?",

    "text": " Access codes for webassign, Pearson and other sites professors what you to use really shouldn’t cost as much as a textbook if your only purchasing the access code. So instead, just login to webassign( or whatever site you’ll be using) and just enter your class code and buy access through them. It’s called an online access code. If you purchase access online, it is automatically applied to your account and it’s normally a fraction of what you pay in the book store. for doing so explaining each one. Same goes for Pearson. You still get the same resources as everyone else, but you’ll be paying much less. Just think about. Why pay, on average, $150 for a code though your bookstore, when you can go directly to the site and pay less. An access code for my algebra class was $190 but paid $90 after setting up my account and buying it on Pearson. Say it’s a scam for me to explain to you that you can go through the homework site with class key in hand. Access codes can expire or be recycled without you knowing. So instead of going to your school’s bookstore, go onto the site, select purchase online accesss purchase, and you’ll be saving money on top of the fact it’s faster than waiting in line for it. It’s one of the many things the bookstore will never tell you, because access codes sell quick.",

      "This is probably true for a lot of colleges, but not all of them. Some colleges/courses (like mine and OP) only list one or two options for purchasing course material. For example, there are two main ways to getting the access code: buying the access code separately and buying a textbook with the access codes.",
      "It's possible that OP's college only provided the textbook option. Getting the ebook version or buying a used textbook is usually a much cheaper option than buying a new physical textbook, so it's usually better to buy the access code separately. Furthermore, some college bookstores only list access codes/subscription prices for maybe one semester.",
      "Sometimes for classes with multi-semester sequences like Calc and Chem, it can be advantageous to purchase multi-term access codes/subscriptions since that's usually cheaper. Again, colleges can have the opposite problem as above: they only offer multi-term access codes when you might only need a one-semester access code.

      "Paying $150 for an access code is a scam. Just go to the website you’ll be using for you homework. Access codes for webassign, Pearson and other sites professors what you to use really shouldn’t cost as much as a textbook if your only purchasing the access code.",
      "This is probably true for a lot of colleges, but not all of them. Some colleges/courses (like mine and OP) only list one or two options for purchasing course material. For example, there are two main ways to getting the access code: buying the access code separately and buying a textbook with the access codes.",
      "So instead, just login to webassign( or whatever site you’ll be using) and just enter your class code and buy access through them.",
      "It's possible that OP's college only provided the textbook option. Getting the ebook version or buying a used textbook is usually a much cheaper option than buying a new physical textbook, so it's usually better to buy the access code separately. Furthermore, some college bookstores only list access codes/subscription prices for maybe one semester.",
      "It’s called an online access code.",
      "Sometimes for classes with multi-semester sequences like Calc and Chem, it can be advantageous to purchase multi-term access codes/subscriptions since that's usually cheaper. Again, colleges can have the opposite problem as above: they only offer multi-term access codes when you might only need a one-semester access code. For example, my prof was able to talk to the college's publisher rep and get discounted prices for multi-term access codes so that the difference between 1 semester's worth and 4 semesters was like $14.",
      "If you purchase access online, it is automatically applied to your account and it’s normally a fraction of what you pay in the book store.",
      "This is true. I got finessed by amazon buying a book that explicitly said comes with an access code and it didn’t. Got the access code directly from Pearson after that for like $70 and returned the book.",

I paid for the class independently without an access code last semester, and now i have to pay for it again because the class from last semester is over.

      "Just think about.",
      "But purchasing through amazon (good return policy) meant that I could buy that code for $30 or so and if it didn't work, I could just return it.",
      "I sell used books (and access codes) on Amazon. Why pay, on average, $150 for a code though your bookstore, when you can go directly to the site and pay less.. An access code for my algebra class was $190 but paid $90 after setting up my account and buying it on Pearson.",

I never even saw myself going to college so the fact that I am even going for an a.a.s is a huge deal for me. My a.a.s wouldn't transfer well into a bachelor's degree since most of the classes are web development/programming classes versus gen Ed classes. I feel like I'm already learning more than what I did (I dabbled in web development for a year before I went for my degree) I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot by only going for an associates of applied science, and that I should have went for a whole bachelor's degree instead of half assing it like my friend says I am. But I also know people are getting into web development even without a degree so surely having an a.a.s in web development could only help? To be honest, my friend never went to college. They currently work at a warehouse their father works at after working at a gas station. A part of me feels like my friend is actually jealous that I am finally doing something with myself, but I also worry that's just me being too big headed of myself. I just have a lot of anxiety about my future",

These are a huge plus for long study sessions when you have noisy roommates. Even when just traveling for things they are a godsend. You can use them for just about anything whether listening to class lectures online or watching some class video, Netflixing, gaming, working out, talking on the phone, or just listening to music that makes it sound good with the headphones. Cons: They can be expensive for a good pair and not everyone can afford them even for some Sony, Bose, or Apple airpods pro they can be $250+ Over the ear have longer battery life that can last me half or most of the week, but they still have to be charged. Nothing that can be done at night though or other times when not being used. Not a big list, but just wanted to make my case for them as they really are worth the money if you can spare a few hundred.",

So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning 4 chapters over break, each chapter containing 4 30-minute lecture videos, accompanied by a 30 minute timed quiz for each video. He’s just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. We got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November 29th (the day we get back) So he’s basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these 4 chapters is also the day we get back from break. So I’m wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I’m so stressed out and now I won’t even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor Update: Wow, I didn’t expect to be given so much good advice Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. I ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only 16 20-minute quizzes, not 32 as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of 4 chapters, each with 4 videos and a quiz after each video. It makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it’s still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. If I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus 2 in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his “teaching strategy.” Thanks all!",

I honestly thought I was actually going to pass this one, but when I went back and checked my answers I found a lot of them were wrong. I tried to correct them but ran out of time and ended up getting them wrong anyway. This always happens to me. My average is sitting at a 63 (Math 110). I have to take the final exam in a week, and it is pretty much a foregone conclusion that I am going to fail because I have failed every test this semester and I often don't even understand the homework assignments enough to finish them. I work full time and this is my third time taking the class. I have dropped it twice already and I even dropped my other two classes to focus on math this semester and I am still going to fail. I live in the middle of nowhere and my work and school are each about a 45 minute drive in different directions. I have pretty much already decided that I am going to quit my job so that I can spend the summer just focusing on school. I hate that I have to do this and it won't always be an option. The only reason I can do it now is because I still live with my Mom and have saved up a good amount of money. If I am going to do this I want to do it right, so that I can finally be done with community college and move out of my shithole hometown. I have always been horrible at math and I am honestly not sure that I even passed Math 100. I finished the class with a 69 and my teacher said he would just give some bonus points to round up, but my transcript still says 69. This constant struggle with math plus all of the withdrawals I have piled up from other classes makes me seriously worried about my academic future. This is the only thing making me miserable and causing the depression to come back when I'm otherwise feeling better than I have in years. I will take all of the advice I can as to how I can pass this class. I would rather do so without having to devote my every waking hour doing shit that I hate if it all possible. The good news though is that as a Psychology major I don't think that I have to take anymore math after Math 112. I am prepared to buckle down and do whatever it takes to pass these classes, but I have already been in community college for over 3 years and I can't keep wasting time and money here forever.",

I'm assuming it's because they're out of the highschool relationships phase and just want to experiment.... but I'm not even at stage 1 of kissing. People always tell me \"Oh well relationships aren't worth it, and heartbreak sucks....\" but I'd like to atleast experience it to learn. I mean I want to get married one day and I'd like to atleast know how to be with someone. I feel so behind. Like I get excited at the idea that guys would even so much as put their arm around me on the couch watching a movie. And people just say \"awww that's cute, you don't even know how to cuddle.\" It doesn't help that people get shocked when I tell them I haven't had a boyfriend before. All I really want is to feel important to somebody for a little while y'know. Anyways, what can I do? Where do I begin? I'm lost & confused...I need help.",

I had to pay rent and was really in the weeds in terms of finances. Terrible decision. All of my courses were marked as F’s and one D… still don’t know how I got a D(I stopped showing up, didn’t finish the project and never took the final). It’s been a few years now, and I’ve been managing a restaurant. This is not something I want to do forever. During this time away from traditional education I have stayed busy, learning for the field I would like to be working in. I believe in my heart that I am ready for this journey now. I do not think I was ready when I was 18, I had no clue what I wanted from this life. Now with a plan in mind, I have never felt further from my goal. I have no idea how to go about attaining my degree. Should I go to community college again, regain a decent gpa and apply to a 4year college? Or see if I can get in to a 4 year college off the bat? Online college? I am not sure where to begin. Thanks for any tips and tricks offered, it’s much appreciated. I look forward to this journey.",

But, ever since then, I have found a complete lack of motivation to study and procrastinated for many hours each day for many weeks. I ended up going from doing 3 subjects (3/4 load) to 2 subjects (1/2 load). Even now, as I write this I have spent the whole day doing nothing despite 2 major assignments coming up. I know deep down this isn't a time management problem between work and university as I have previously worked many more hours and done more subjects without a problem. I suspect it could be the potential job security and the realisation that barely any of the things you learn in university is actually applicable to real work and that the only useful thing about a Uni degree is that it shows you have the capability to learn and demonstrate a commitment to something...

I know I would not have any trouble finding fun at either as both have top rated greek life and Illinois has a tremendous bar scene and Big 10 sports and Alabama has football.

Obviously though, the campus, partying, and other secondary factors shouldn’t be the main deciding factor and the education and academics are the main focus as my parents have also stressed that. Illinois definitely seems to have the better business school and the overall reputation and selectiveness/prestigiousness are better than Alabama. I also know some people from my high school class going to Alabama who did not have nearly the same grades or course load as I did and obviously still got in there. That’s why I’m worried that going to Alabama over UIUC could be a mistake, but I also know both business schools are still in the top 50, and am not entirely sure if it would make a huge difference in where I get the degree from, as they are both probably still viewed similarly as just state schools to most employers. I’ve also heard that it’s more about what you do in college and not so much the college on your degree. But i’ve put a lot of effort into my high school education and wouldn’t want it to feel like my hard work went to waste if I end up at Alabama instead of the “higher ranked” UIUC.

I told him that I was thinking about minoring in computer science, and he later emailed me and asked if I would be interested in working on a coding project for him. I warned him that I really had no coding experience, I just enjoy learning about the material. But he said it was fine. He gave me his number to talk about the project, and I texted him. But we only talked about casual things, like about his life or my classes and things. We texted consistently throughout the day, and the project never came up. One day, he asked me about where and when I worked, and he showed up at my workplace. He was shopping for himself, but I felt really weird about it. I stopped texting for a while, and he sent multiple messages asking where I was and if I was okay. I just felt weird. He texted me a couple weeks later and asked if we could talk about the project, and I said okay. He suggested meeting at a restaurant to talk about it, and I said okay. He paid for the meal, and it was mainly casual conversation again. We did talk about the project, but at the end of the meal, he made several comments about how I disappeared on him. I felt bad and told him I would try not to again. So we text again, but I just feel weird about it. He showed up at my work again. And I have tried to work on the project, but I just do not have the experience to code what he wants. I am thinking about telling him I can’t do the project. Am I overreacting for being uncomfortable? My friends said that I should report him, but my family says I need to be nicer to him. I don’t want to get him in trouble but I don’t feel comfortable with the relationship we have.",

    "text": " I'm starting to feel like I made a huge mistake. Im a sophomore at a public university that heavily pushes premed and and is surrounded by one of the largest hospital systems in the United States. So i have been on the neuroscience/ premed track for two years already. although it's totally normal to retake a class or two, I have already retaken two foundations courses, twice each. Im about to be a junior and i STILL haven't taken any major related classes yet, like at all. So I don't even KNOW if I like my major or not. I also study a shit ton. I go to office hours, tutoring, I redo quizzes and worksheets, I take practice exams, I sit in the library for hours and study, I even started taking adderall to help me focus more, but I still fail exams (chemistry specifically). Ive been doing pretty well at Bio but that's just because I got super lucky the second time i retook it (aka this semester) and I got a super easy professor. So, the mistake, is that I've waisted the last two years of college taking and retaking foundations/ general courses, and i still have no idea what major I am or what I even want to do outside of \"research\" , because I was just told to take these courses and I would be set. I REALLY do not want to fall into the stereotypical weeded-out-pre-med-to-business category, but I have recently started to listen to my heart and my younger self, and that I am losing my creative and passionate side for learning the more and more I take premed classes. Also, the class averages for harder, upper level courses such as organic chemistry and biochemistry and calculus are around 40%-60%, and calc 2 is the most dropped class at my university, with 25% completion rate. Does anybody else feel this way/ has felt this way? I feel super isolated and alienated right now because it seems like everybody around me, specifically my peers, have it all together and have been making meaningful time here. I also am afraid of being judged and people thinking I'm stupid and not smart enough for not being able to keep going. Any advice or stories will help I really appreciate it thank you",

    "text": " To put it simply, my college career is completely screwed up. Over the last four years, I’ve taken four semesters of college (2 semesters in physical classes and a 2 semesters of online classes). Somehow, for no good reason other than lack of interest/drive to do the work, I’ve managed to fail nearly every single class I have attempted. At it’s lowest, my gpa was a 0.39. I took 3 classes online last summer in which I managed to achieve 2 Bs and an F. That brought my GPA up to 0.80 and I haven’t given it another run since. This is a very different picture than my academic profile in high school: 3.8 GPA, highest SAT score, National Merit Scholar, etc. Needless to say, I lost any and all scholarships I had. I wish I had a better reason for why I’ve done so horribly in college. My father died shortly after I graduated high school, so I used that as an excuse in the mandatory meetings I had to have with advisors due to being on academic probation. But while that was definitely a very sad experience, I can’t honestly say I felt any depression or sadness that was impacting my desire to do school work. The only real reason is that I have been spending my time working on other things, but I know this isn’t a solid justification as I know plenty of people who have excelled in college while working on other business and/or creative ventures on the side. Now, as I watch all the people from my high school class graduating and getting their degrees, I can’t help but wonder if I should give another pass at this or throw in the towel. I haven’t officially thought of myself as a “college dropout” yet, but I also don’t have any concrete plans of returning. Currently, I’m running a small video production company, learning a few instruments and DAW software in hopes of finding success (and skill lol) as a musician, and studying/practicing screenwriting with aspirations to write for (and one day create/executive produce) television shows. While I like to think I’m confident that I can realize my dreams without college, there are times where I can’t help but wonder if I need to give it another shot, just in case. I also feel like I’ve been socially cut off from people in my age group these last few years and worry that it’s negatively impacting my ability to make social connections that could be beneficial in my fields of interest. I’m an introvert so it can be difficult for me to actively place myself in social situations at times. College seems like a bit of an easier way to accomplish this. But then I think about how much of a waste of money and potentially time it could be and go back to square one.",

This is really hard though because I was super set on majoring in a STEM and a humanities because I’m very worried about financial stability after school and I feel having that STEM with me would help immensely, but the fact of the matter is I struggled a LOT. Furthermore, in ecology I struggled the whole time while with Oceanography (a geology class) I worked hard and pulled off an A despite struggling.

      "I hope I didn’t startle you… it’s been really nice actually sharing this… I hope you are able to find comfort with your time as an RA.

But that doesn’t define them, and you were there when they needed the support.",

      "Please talk to someone, A professor you’re close to that you trust, the dean of students, the suicide prevention hotline for your school, anyone you really trust. There is so much depression out there now it’s a really sad time and your feelings are valid and there should be someone to help you with this if you search them out. Good luck.",
      "it was very distressing and shocking to see and of course i feel horrible for person and that someone could go to such extent.",
      "He didn’t wanting me getting anyone for help, but I was qualified to handle the situation… I was able to just chat with him and calm him down, invited him out to lunch the next day to give him something to stick around a little longer for, then instantly went to his RA’s room upon leaving. From there, I got the RA, office of residence life, and office of the dean involved, and it made a difference for him. It never impacted, which I find concerning.",
      "has anyone experienced anything similar?",
      "Potentially triggering for you, just a heads up I had a really similar situation… last spring semester, a freshman joined my student org. One night, I drove him to his dorm and went in with him."

I think today I’m going to be brutally honest with him. Maybe even mean. I’m out of options here. My house eboard won’t get involved. All they will do “mediate a conversation” between the two of us. I can have a conversation on my own. This kid needs to be told that no one likes being near him because his stench is nauseating. Anyone got any tips or something?",

He also encourages emails with questions often so I feel no shame for emailing him once a week or so with specific questions. Of the seven emails I've sent over the last 12 weeks, he has responded to 2. His past students and current have complained that he does not respond in a timely manner, if at all. I only noticed this AFTER I decided to take the class. We ended up having a test due on a Sunday over a section we had not covered yet and wouldn't open until the following day. I emailed him Saturday to confirm (it opened Friday, so Saturday was not short notice) and he didn't respond. Sunday, no response either. I ended up reaching out individually to my classmates and they confirmed that they couldn't see the new module open for the test either. I even had one say he never responds to her emails and she emailed him, too. Everyone kind of bombed that test. And on Monday I decided to email him and tag the dept head. I asked what the best way to communicate with him would be, what I can do to get him to respond to me in at least 48 hours, and what exactly we should have done about the test. He responded very angrily with \"you should check your junk email box, because I've responded to EVERY email you've sent me\". Okay, buddy. Now that I've lit a fire under your ass, this is the response? Of course my junk email box was not full. I even have this professor in my contacts for this reason alone because I thought that was a possibility at one point.",

So why should I become a teacher if I have absolutely no interest in being one? I understand that you need to approach life from their perspective, a practical and realistic one, but I really have other passions in life. I want to advance my music career, I'm a musician for one thing. I want to be a journalist, potentially a music journalist. That is where my passion is.

My parent's rationale is that teaching is a \"good playing job\", and a \"stable career\" which both are true, but it is not the only career option in the world, and being a teacher is incredibly stressful.",
      "They’re not wrong about teaching being a profession that is perhaps more secure than journalism or music journalism, but 1) you can teach anything you learn, just have to take some more steps and 2) don’t study (to teach) something you’re not interested in like history, if you don’t like it, it may be hard for you, you may not be good at it, you may have no motivation to advance your knowledge, etc I would say find a balance between what you want to do and showing your parents you will still be secure.",
      "So why should I become a teacher if I have absolutely no interest in being one?",
      "Why don’t you tell your parents you want to study journalism (instead of history) and possibly teach journalism at a college or university level. Tell them you’re more passionate about journalism than history, and either way, you can teach.",
      "I understand that you need to approach life from their perspective, a practical and realistic one, but I really have other passions in life.",
      "Journalism is not history, but history brings a lot to journalism. Merge historically-informed analysis with your musical knowledge, and it seems like a perfect match for a music journalist.",
      "I want to advance my music career, I'm a musician for one thing.",
      "There's lots of stuff you can do with a history degree outside of teaching history. And when your parents give you guff about it, politely tell them to keep their opinions about how YOU are going to spend the next 40 years of YOUR life to themselves.",
      "I want to be a journalist, potentially a music journalist.",
      "Teaching can be stable, but it really isn't that great of a paying job. Teachers are notoriously overworked and undercompensated for their efforts. If you change your majors, and your parents provide financial assistance, just be prepared for the possibility of having that rug pulled out from under you.",
      "I agree with you here, thank you for the advice. That is where my passion is.",
      "Don't worry about it now. If your parents want you to go into teaching, remind them that you can get a teaching credential with any major.",
      "😂. It's so frustrating that I can't plead my case at all to my parents.",
      "They are grossly underpaid for what they do and it’s a very high stress job. I think you should switch to a different major."

      "Coming from the side of the spectrum that has no college friends and has no intention of trying to change that, it’s probably not you. Some people just stick to their friends outside of school and are so busy that they don’t feel like they have time for new ones.",
      "That makes sense. People seem uncomfortable around me and like they can’t wait to get away.",
      "PS, part of the reason I don’t want to make new friends is because I’m older than most people in my grade, have a job, and have lived in this town for a while. Maybe try reaching out to other transfer students who have just recently moved or joint a club specific to your major? They’d probably have the most in common with you.",

I too had my trouble, but here is what helped me: First, don't just go to any clubs, go to things you are genuinely passionate or interested in and just go to it consistently.",
      "Thank you this is good advice. I am very socially awkward",

    "title:": "I really blew it - Please help",
    "text": " This is a really long one- but please stick with me. I need some real help and I'm breaking down here trying to figure it out. I've written this much because the problem could be anywhere in here and I want the best advice I can get. To preface, I was a high performer in high school (Class of 2020). By no means was I a particularly good student, but I was a high performer, and I've read tons and tons at this point on the issues that are associated with that/being labeled \"gifted\"/etc. I never really had to apply a ton of study skills in high school therefore and never really had the chance to learn them. I was both smart and decently privileged, so anywhere that my smarts couldn't make up for the study skills, a tutor or my mom was there to catch me. I pretty much nailed high school with the exception of like one B in Senior year after COVID hit. Graduated with honors, wasn't valedictorian but that was fine, the kid who got it really deserved it. In the summer leading up to college, I got accepted to my dream school, which was awesome, but a lot of family issues resulted from it. Toxic father who was abusive as both a parent and a spouse who insisted to pay for college for the sake of status, but also refused to pay for any school unless I landed ridiculous amounts of scholarship money... you know how it goes. Eventually we managed to get him to pay for my dream school, since I didn't get in on any scholarship and our blessed situation financially didn't really award any financial aid. I promise this becomes important later, just stick with me here. Of course, because this was the summer of 2020, this is when COVID really changed the college scene and my school offered the option to go online, so naturally this is what I did since my whole family was really COVID-conscious. Fall semester comes around... and given how I started this, you're probably expecting me to say this is where I flopped, but truthfully, I actually NAILED first year. I even managed to develop all the work ethic and good study habits, along with having a thriving social life while at home! All As in primarily important pre-med stem classes with an extra elective I wanted to take. Only got an A- in the lab Gen Chem lab. I had the option to take Spring semester remote as well, so I did that. At this point, a huge family crisis hit where we finally just hit the peak of the bs my father was putting my mother, sister, and I through, and he filed for a divorce behind my mom's back after she suggested they could file together. This became an incredibly stressful situation on top of being ostracized from an online friend group I'd been in for a year and a breakup with my girlfriend of three year at the time. My coping mechanisms weren't the greatest, but I trudged through the semester and did alright. Somewhat lighter course load, in all fairness, but all As and A-s, with one B+ from Gen Chem (which would have been an A if I didn't botch the final), so that's still incredible performance. In all fairness, I also made a lot of excuses in my lighter, less-serious classes that allowed me extensions on certain assignments and such, but that's still incredible performance and I'm not afraid to flaunt that. Ended freshman year on a 3.8/9 (depending on how you round it) GPA. However, due to the panic at the time, my mom really was panicked about that B+ in Gen Chem, so we decided it would be a good idea to get Organic out of the way ASAP, so I took it during the summer. That was hell, but I came out with a B-, but my mom and I, being so used to how I was performing in high school, felt it wouldn't be a bad idea to just take it again during the school year since I've already seen the material once now and can just nail it next time, while also taking Bio and some other lighter classes (that would fit my now major, Psychology). It also was a huge hit to my confidence and momentum, alongside what I perceived to now be another huge pressure I needed to compensate for when I got to school in the Fall. Here's the juicy part. Sophomore year The divorce situation between my parents boiled on for the entirety of that winter semester, through the summer and fall semester, and finally ended during the Spring break of this past Spring 2022 semester. It only became worse and worse, and with my moving out, I wasn't able to handle it well at all, especially since on the big move-out day (remember I was remote that entire first year), my father trounced all over it by calling in his moving crew to move out to his apartment the same day. My coping mechanisms with the whole ordeal were awful, and I had also recently rekindled my relationship with the girl who broke up with me during Spring 2021 (we found out a lot of our issues were based on gaslit misunderstandings from some 'friends' we had who hated what we had going on... we're healthier and happier than ever with each other now). So I was spending a lot of time with her over the phone trying to cope. At first, things still felt exciting and fresh and new. I renovated my room from the worst building on campus into something AMAZING (not to brag). My first couple weeks I was studying hard and good, but it all just started to catch up with me. My work ethic just vanished. All that change I'd made and resilience I had to the family situation and other problems in freshman year just vanished. I was breaking down, I was skipping classes (which I had never done even once up until this point), and was doing so pretty unapologetically. I was suddenly having intense trouble grasping material well enough to do anything on exams, even when I felt just as confident as I would in freshman year before exams that I aced. I tried talking to on-campus counselors and therapists and they were nice but it just wasn't helping. I took courses from the Student Wellness Center to see what I might be missing, but I just couldn't do it. I knew and know what I have to do but I just can't do it. I know I need to put in the work, but I've stopped studying diligently and regularly too. That whole first semester I didn't really even have close friends on campus aside from my roommate, because I became a shut-in, but in the last two weeks of Fall 2021 I managed to find some really nice people who I'm now close friends with. I even start making the walk to classes, then just sitting outside the classroom or building. It's right there. It's just another 50 footsteps away, but I don't go in. My confidence kept taking more and more hits as I'd mess up even incredibly easy classes. Fall 2021 ended with one A in a basically gimme-A class, a B-, and all Cs. It's only during Spring 2022 when I managed to fix my issues of attendance and start actually getting up in the mornings consistently and going to classes and not just staying outside, and even now, my grades are technically doing even worse. I ended up with a midterm deficiency for my absences in one of my classes. I used standing witness in my parents' trial to skip out on some midterms whose credit have been shifted onto my upcoming finals. I don't want to be a bad student or a bad person but I really just feel like I somehow randomly am now. I really want to do well. I just can't find the drive, focus, or motivation to do any of what I need to do now. My semester is yet again looking like it's going to finish out on Bs and Cs, which, while not the worst thing ever, is certainly not gonna cut it for med schools. I've made it this far, and even got myself together during my freshman year of college. I managed to overcome that typical gifted-kid burnout slump or whatever it is. I overcame my lack of study skills, time, management, and social awkwardness I had in high school. Then I move out to college after doing the first year remote with a few unnecessary hits to my self-confidence over things that really weren't big problems in hindsight, a bunch of extra problems on my back, and no ways to properly cope that are genuinely helping me. The interesting part of the issue here is not the same thing about high-performing high school students doing bad in college. It's about actually getting myself together after high school, nailing freshman year and not even feeling too burnt out, making one mistake (that I blew way out of proportion) at a bad time when everything else in my life comes crashing down, and now it's all gone. I keep feeling remotivated to try and try again but then two days after I get that motivation burst I just fall back into it all. I'm so tired and don't know what to do. I can't find anything on even remotely similar situations, but there has to be someone out there, right? Please. Someone help me. I'm so tired and scared. I'm not gonna make any huge life-altering or ending decisions so please don't worry about that. But just, please. Someone help me. I don't know what to do. What tried and worked before isn't working anymore. Help me.",

Mom forced me into college right after high school, but I dropped out after 1 year because I was a complete slacker and I was scared of going into debt for a degree I potentially wouldn't use. Fast forward 6 years, and here I am as a 24 year old dude who's wondering what in the world little 18 year old me was thinking. It's almost as if I've been sleepwalking and I'm finally waking up to the fact that if I want to do well in life, I'll likely need a degree in a promising field (no, I don't want to do a trade job). One minor problem... I'm freaking scared AF because I haven't written an essay, or answered a single math problem in six years. In high school, the hardest class I took was Chem and I got a D, because I never applied myself (and now I deeply regret it). The most advanced math class I took was college algebra. 18 year old me did whatever it took to make sure he never had to use his brain I guess. Now having woken up, I have a strong desire to go back to school, apply myself and get a degree in computer science. I plan on enrolling in a local junior college, and then transferring to obtain my Bachelor's. So here's my question: I feel as though I lack the foundational knowledge that most high school students have when they begin their first year of college. Do you guys think I should start taking some online math courses/other courses on my own as I wait for junior college enrollment? If so, what should be studying so I'm not completely shell shocked when I start school back up? Or, do you think I'll be okay and that college will ease me back into it all?

    "text": " I am taking a medical Spanish course. It's considered introductory and we're just learning to count to 500. There is a lot of vocabulary - over 200 terms in just one week of classes. It's difficult to memorize everything, even with daily practice. This girl joined the class a week late. As soon as she joined the Webex meeting, she interrupted a classmate that was trying to pronounce a word, and spoke in fluent Spanish \"Sorry I'm late, I felt that I didn't need the review.\" The professor loved that she spoke Spanish and they frequently have conversations that the rest of us can't understand. She does not have a textbook and claims she doesn't need one. Whenever someone pronounces something wrong, she rolls her eyes. I have noticed that, since she joined, the professor is going faster. We learned 60 terms in one class. The professor asked us if we wanted to review numbers, and the girl spoke up and said \"Absolutely not, that's too easy\" before anyone else had the chance to say anything. I no longer want to participate much because I'm embarrassed to say something wrong. I also have 6 other classes and having 200 terms to review and memorize for one class is weighing on me. This girl is making everyone uncomfortable and I can tell we feel like we're falling behind. I'm not sure why people fluent in Spanish are allowed to take an introductory Spanish course in college. It's an easy A, sure, which is great for her, but not really teaching her anything. Our final is a conversation with the professor in Spanish as if we are talking to a patient - the girl jokingly asked if she could get it over with now. Should I just drop? Should I say something? I feel like the professor should understand the rest of us have little to no experience with speaking Spanish and are here to start from the beginning, but she's absolutely being influenced by the girl knowing everything.",

    "text": " Hi I am a 20yo currently about to start my junior year of college. My work load is very low, and I work a full time job to pay rent, save, pay school payments, etc. I have a dog back at home (4 hours from my college) and I often get upset that my family doesn’t seem to be taking care of him the way he should be. He’s a small yorkie, and actually doesn’t have too much energy, but they lock him in his cage most of the day and don’t actually play with him or take him on walks. I live in a pet-friendly apartment, so my boyfriend suggested me bringing my yorkie here. I’ve made plans to get him from home at the end of the month, but the nerves are definitely starting to kick in. I’m extremely anxious about this. I do work Monday-Friday and have a boyfriend and social life that I enjoy, so it definitely overwhelms me a little thinking of how to maintain everything and adding my dog into the mix. My boyfriend lives at a different complex, but reassured me that he’d be more than willing to help and that our close friends would pitch in if I ever needed it. I guess I’m just asking if anyone has brought their dog to college and regretted it? EDIT/UPDATE: thanks everyone for being so kind and helpful (: I know I’m anxious for a reason and I know I have genuine concerns. BUT it’s very clear to me that I have no other choice than to bring my little buddy!",

      "Ultimately, college is one of the only times that you have complete independence, and by having a dog I lost some of that independence. But, it was definitely worth a try and helped me get used to college.",

      "The big thing to keep in mind is that he could hace health issues at any given time. You seem to be doing much better than I financially, so I would suggest keeping a few hundred dollars aside in case anything happens. My first semester of college, a few weeks in, my cat had to have surgery for pyometra which cost me about $700 in the end, but they only needed $250 up front.",

It was, for me, one of the best decisions that I made Having a dog really forced me to make a schedule and prioritize better, and I definitely went out/partied less, but the constant companionship was honestly worth it I’m going into my senior year now with him, and I wouldn’t have it any other way!",

      "I have never once regretted having Penny with me in college. I fought with disability services for months trying to get approval for an emotional support animal because they told me I didn't seem \"sick enough.\" If your apartment is pet friendly you should definitely get your dog!",

    "text": " So yeah as the title says I've lived with a tonne of people since moving into halls, I've lived with some truly awesome people who I consider close to family and on the flip side purely psychotic people who affected the health of everyone in the flat. I know a lot of freshers are nervous about moving into halls for the first time so I'm here to impart some wisdom, some of it may sound harsh but from experience it helps in the long run. Set your boundaries early on, don't wait until after freshers week to tell them what you are and aren't ok with, they'll just take the piss. Be as strict as you need to with them, only after they've proven themselves should you ease up on them, its better to be told 'hey I thought you were a bitch but you're actually ok' rather than 'why you such an arsehole, you used to be fun' While first impressions are good you won't get to know what you flatmates are truly like until they're stressed and under pressure. So try not to get too attached early on, they could change into very different people over a few weeks. If drama doesn't directly involve you, do not get involved and that includes asking what is going on cos that can be used as ammunition as you know what going on so they'll want your opinion. It's fair easier and better for your mental health to be on the sidelines. Stuff in the communal areas WILL get messed with and sometimes broken, if its valuable to you don't leave it where others can get to it. If pans get scratched or glasses broken or something else of yours gets broken, dont hesitate to demand it be replaced. Get to know your RA or the caretakers or people at reception, if you get to know them they'll be more willing to bend the rules. Just don't take the piss Get a support network set up as soon as possible, personal tutors, guidance tutors, academic mentors, whatever you need, it's far easier setting it up in the beginning so it's there when you need it rather than trying to find out who to talk to when your swamped with work or really down mentally Don't be intimidated by the hard man, they more often than not all bark not bite and tend to show off to their posse. Dont be threatened. Some freshers tend to go off the rails, it's the first time away from home without mum and dad to tell them what to do, if they're being shit, tell them and call them out, you're all living in that flat together and you gotta cooperate and sometimes a few people need to be knocked down a few pegs. If you're not ok with something, speak up and stand your ground and don't let it be dismissed, it's your house too and you deserve to feel comfortable and be respected. If someone ends up being an arse, feel free to give them a second chance but if they take it for granted feel free to just ignore them. You're under no obligation to interact with them, sometimes a sudden change of attitude from you will get them to realise they've effed up. If nothing changes oh well. Watch out for local pets wandering around, especially cats, they tend to jump in windows and get stuck or people start feeding them and they hang around, if you can contact the owners to see if they're aware or lost pet pages if you can't. Sometimes they don't come home for a long time cos the students have ham. If you don't feel safe in your flat or you don't feel like you're meshing very well, there is no shame in switching flats. Chances are if you're not meshing well or if your flatmates are arseholes they aren't really gonna care. Look after yourself and your health and safety.",

Now, I feel my motivation has changed to a heavy pressure that I MUST get in grad school to survive. I can't support myself otherwise.

If you choose a major that you’re passionate about and pursue it, you’re more likely to find yourself in the 50-100% points.

As long as you find something in your field, it’s the wage + the investment you’re making in yourself that will pay off later.",

At 18, you may not have the ability to understand finances and student loans, but you are absolutely capable of researching your major and the future employment possibilities.",

      "I don’t feel this way at all, although I am worried about finding a job. When picking a major I specifically only considered majors that would make enough money for me to live comfortably. Obviously you can’t change that now, but maybe grad school will work out.",

      "Previously my motivation for graduate school was to help others with research that was that had an impact on society.",
      "If you are asking why graduate school is required for other opportunities, it's because a bachelor's degree does not train you in therapy and we have higher standards considering it's a medical care profession. But if you do not want to go to grad school (and honestly, unless you are doing a professional degree, you should not be paying for it), then you do not have to limit yourself to jobs that are strictly \"psychology\" in nature. going the PhD route, you should receive funding with any good offer.",
      "Now, I feel my motivation has changed to a heavy pressure that I MUST get in grad school to survive.",
      "Note to any freshman/undecided majors out there that are reading this, remember to look at job outlook when declaring a major, and figure out what you want to do before declaring.",

My first year of college (2017-18) was fine, pretty lonely but I made some friends and got to party some, all classes went fine. Second year was more of the same. My third year I had to move to the tiny satellite campus away from the main one away from my friends so that sucked super hard. Then just when things started to look better COVID hit. And everything just went to shit. So now I'm accustomed to half assing everything. Why go to class when you could just go to a zoom meeting. Why pay attention in class when you can just look at the notes later. Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet. I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks. When you compare my first year of college, I was in a classroom half the day, studying in the library, sleeping in the dorms, making friends and partying. Now compare that to now, I'm half listening to lectures on my phone at my apartment, getting B's on open note open internet tests, trying to piece together what I'm supposed to do from canvas announcements, emails, and groupMe messages. Never socializing, just spending all my time with my boyfriend and aunt and uncle. Never partying or going out or doing anything fun, just smoking too much weed at home in a desperate attempt to keep myself entertained. On top of all that this goddamn Texas snowstorm just threw a fucky wrench into everything even further. So I'm dealing with a natural disaster on top of a pandemic.",

I know admissions were brutal for a lot of other people but they all still have great backup options I would die for and I just have nothing to be proud of. Anyways I'm going on a tangent, my best options for business right now are SJSU (too close/don't like San Jose) UCR (idk about the people /environment there; location is not ideal), or Chapman (too expensive even with a scholarship/not a lot diversity). They're all fine schools but none of them I feel like are right for me and also not what I envision. My dream is Berkeley, Cal Poly, SDSU (rejected but appealing to cal poly), and UCI (waitlisted... but they prob don't want me :( I believe a community college is a great option as well but I don't know if I could handle the isolation and FOMO for two years( yea whatever call me weak idgaf). I don't wanna be like that but I just can't help it. I am a very social person who has an intense need to fit in and whenever I am lonely I become really destructive to myself. if that makes sense. With CC, I'm missing out on the experience which I would hope might make up for the fact that I didn't get into the school I wanted to if attended the schools listed above. I may be wrong, but I also feel like I would need to work even harder with classes, extracurriculars, applications, etc., and at this point, I'm done and mentally drained. I am also not guaranteed any of my dreams. schools because those ones do not participate in TAG so there is a chance that cc would be all for nothing and I would still have to settle... again. I don't even know at this point, this shi be too depressing. Help a sista out, please also if anyone has any tips on how to not be depressed during this time please share, the pain is too much sometimes :(",

I have an amazing girlfriend who I hang out with every day, and she has great friends who are also my friends, but I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for her, I probably wouldn’t really ever find ways to hang out with them since I never reach out to them on my own, and they are all girls, which makes me feel like a bit of an oddball and makes me wonder if I’m annoying being the only guy there. Idk, I just wonder how people meet friends, and also how they actually make a lasting one too because so far it’s been a lot harder than I could’ve imagined",

    "text": " So I had a midterm this week and got in a serious car accident the day before. (the midterm was only open during the day it was due.) I was unable to do the exam, and in the course syllabus it states, “Make-up tests are given only if there is solid evidence of a medical or otherwise serious emergency that prevented the student from taking the exam”. I wrote her an email stating my situation and offered to provide all documentation as necessary. My professor replied that since they went over the test during the following day’s lecture, there is nothing I can do to make it up. My grade went from an 85 to a 51. EDIT 1: So I should probably clear this up. I emailed the professor before the test was due, and she didn’t respond. Then I followed up after the test was due. I also didn’t make it to class where they reviewed the test, but the lectures are recorded so technically I could go look at the answers at any time. EDIT 2: Some of you are asking for the exact wording from my professor so here it is. The first email I sent, several hours BEFORE the test was due was where I explained my situation and stated that I would be unable to take the test on the given date and asked if I can make it up. To this I got no response. Then I sent a second email the next day asking again if I can make up the test in some way, as the syllabus says I should be allowed to. Professor replied to my email with, “No you can not make up the test. The solutions were covered in class. Thank you.” Hope this clears the confusion. Is there anything I can do in this situation? Can I message someone higher up in my college about this? I can’t really afford to fail this class, especially not for a reason such as this.",

Note: Don’t contact the chair.",

      "Yes, this is directly against the syllabus, as well as department and school policy. Some professors include a clause that a low test grade can be dropped or replaced with the final at the end of the semester to protect against this. You need to contact the chair in that situation."

    "text": " I (18F) am going to be a sophomore in university this fall. I commuted my first year since I live about 5 minutes from campus and it helped save a lot of money. I really want to live on campus at some point in college, and I think doing so my sophomore year is best, then go back home for my junior and senior year. However, my parents keep trying to talk me out of it that it doesn’t make sense and “the college experience” isn’t worth so much debt, especially since I’ll be going to a further school for my masters and will have to live on campus then. I know they are right. I’ll owe a lot of money. But all my teenage years I haven’t made any solid friends and have never even been in a relationship. I just wanted to live on campus to get that chance, but my parents say living at home is like living on campus because of how close we are to the school but I think that’s very wrong. They’ll also have to help pay a lot of my tuition, which makes me even more guilty. I know I’ll owe a lot, but I just want to be free and finally live a little. What do I do?",

    "text": " So it’s my freshman year of college and I’ve been here for about two months by now. Specifically, I attend an art school that’s relatively rigorous in terms of workload. For the most part though I had been able to manage my work fine, but then midterms rolled in. I was pulling all nighters left and right for all of my projects and getting 0-2 hours of sleep almost every day. Today, I had a midterm in art history and I had the bright idea to once again, pull another all nighter. I thought I had the willpower to do so but I ended up passing out at around 7am and then waking up in horror at around 3pm. I had slept through all of my 37 alarms (Also apologies to my roommate I’m trying to get better at it) and missed my midterm. I frantically emailed my professor and told him my situation and if there’s a remedy to this whole disaster, but I have a good feeling he’s not going to cut me any slack. I don’t really know what to do at this point and if I should just withdraw from the class because the only grades we get are a midterm, final paper, and final exam. (the midterm is 25% of our grade haha end me) So if I get a 0 on the midterm is there really any hope for getting that up to a passing grade? Also if I fail a class does that mean I have to wait another year to graduate because I was a couple of credits short?",

Many dorms are a bit old, and it shows. And the people in charge can make some pretty stupid decisions, which was shown to the T during quarantine. I go to a mid-sized school in NJ, so I'm not sure if its just the area in general or what. I know the colleges in my area, besides maybe the Ivy league schools, are nothing spectacular compared to the south or even places like California. But what about you guys? Is it common for people to complain about things pertaining to the college frequently? Is it normal for people to like the college at first but then eventually start to see the not-so-good parts? If there is little to no complaining at your college, please say it so I know whether its widespread or not?",

Apparently he has an unlimited plan but hates d-hall, so instead, he has let one other friend just use his virtual ID by editing it and blocking out the side with his face and name leaving only the barcode, use the phone scanner since the staff never check, and bam his friend now eats more than ramen lol. I'll admit that I'm tempted, mainly because I don't have the means to cook healthy food and ramen has gotten sickening. I also can't buy anymore mealswipes or dining bucks until the next semester.

    "text": " A little background: In this class there are approximately 100 students, so it’s not a tiny class. The professor gives out pop quizzes every class period as well rather than taking attendance. Well as you might guess, a handful of people only come to class for the quizzes and then leave afterwards. The professor has called people out as they’re leaving the class so now people try to sneak out when she isn’t looking. The first few times were whatever but she keeps doing it and is getting more confrontational with the class. Today someone was sleeping and she stopped the entire lecture to wake them up, then began talking about how disrespectful the people leaving and sleeping in class are. I don’t necessarily disagree but it’s nobody else’s business and they aren’t really disrupting anything in a large class compared to when she goes out of her way to call them out. Anyways, this all became more personal today. I use an iPad and apple pencil to take notes in class and keep my phone in my bag to not get distracted by it. I also sit in the last row of seats in the center because I don’t feel as anxious and can focus better. A little while after she called out the sleeping student, she stops class again. This time, she’s staring right at me from the podium (there’s nobody sitting in the seats in front of me) then proceeds to tell me to get off of my phone, talks about how disrespectful I’m being and how it’s always people who sit in the back that do these things. At this point everyone is looking around and some are looking at me. I was super confused and held up my iPad which was in one hand and my pencil in the other to say “Hey, no phone here”. I definitely couldn’t focus properly after that and could barely write because my hands were shaking so much. I feel like it’s becoming more aggressive and uncomfortable for people. I’m kind of conflicted on if this is something I should bring up to the dean or if I’m just being sensitive and to just note it on the evaluation at the end of the semester. Any advice would be appreciated.",

    "text": " Hey you guys, I have a question about a class rule instituted by one of my professors and your opinions on the “validity” of it or not. I’m taking a class on Native Americans for an American lit credit. This will involve talking about specific tribes and their (sorry in advance?) cultures and beliefs. For our first assignment we had to watch a video about a Canadian community and their struggle to maintain their traditional customs after encroachment from corporations on their land. In class, I said something to the effect of “I admired their tenacity and their fight to hold on to their ways of life,” which my professor then used to go on a tirade about how she found the pronouns “they” and “their” when talking about Native tribes “dehumanizing” and “creating an us/them” situation. This has me baffled because there is simply no alternative pronoun to use when referring to a group in English, and the pronoun usage itself is more linguistic expediency than “otherizing” language, in my estimation. She also provided no alternatives for the class to use. So my question is, have any of you heard things similar in your own classes, and what is your opinion of that? Is this a viable thing to promote, or do you foresee there being issues with this class? Edit to add: title should say “third person plural” for clarity",

      "Your professor is choosing an extremely odd hill to die on and I would maybe bring it up with her again, tell her why you're confused, and if that doesn't go well bring it up with her boss, typically the chair of her department. Speaking as a graduate student who does nothing but read and write, I use they/them pronouns all the time, and I study East Asian cultures.",
      "You may want to approach the teacher and ask for an example on how it should be worded. I am pretty sure she wants it reworded something like the \"the tenacity of Native American community is admirable\" or something along the lines where the pronoun usage is not excessive. in a college essay/admissions scenario, we often get underwhelmed by the excessive use of pronouns in student essays.",
      "Sometimes professors have their methods which may be effective (or not).

I just got a call from my advisor saying he made a mistake and I’m somehow missing a core business class I need to graduate. I’ll still get to walk but have to take a 10 week online class over the summer. Don’t really have many people to talk to about this so thought I’d turn to Reddit. Just disappointed I was sitting here thinking I was studying for my last exam, I feel defeated and unaccomplished.",

    "text": " Stuff happened and this semester I completely burned out due to trying to graduate on time by taking extra classes because I didn’t dual enroll like my other classmates. My depression got out of control and now I’m not passing a class. My classes are too intensive to take 5 at once in the fall. Therefore, I will graduate next spring with taking one class in spring 2023 I didn’t pass, and 4 in fall 2023. I can’t go on social media right now because even though I am happy for my classmates, I can’t help but feel bitter for my situation. I’m kinda mad of how I listened to poor academic advice from people close to me but I can’t go back in time and it is what it is. I’m embarrassed to be graduating late, I have to answer to everyone about why I’m still in school while 90% of the people I grew up with in my life all go onto their careers and just other things in general. Not only that, now I will be lonely and the friends I do have will all be younger than me. That’s fine except that subconsciously it makes me feel out of place. I now gotta make a new group of friends I suppose. I always the hear the saying “You’re no competition with anyone, go at your own pace”. But how do I accept and internalize that? I’m even bitter at the fact that I seemed to have less fun, experiences, and times out than anyone I know my age. How can I get over this and move on?",

Stuff happened and this semester I completely burned out due to trying to graduate on time by taking extra classes because I didn’t dual enroll like my other classmates.. My depression got out of control and now I’m not passing a class.. My classes are too intensive to take 5 at once in the fall.. Therefore, I will graduate next spring with taking one class in spring 2023 I didn’t pass, and 4 in fall 2023.",

      "Hi I’m a college junior and this morning I woke up to an email sent to my mother from my math professor.",

      "in it my professor divulges to my mom not only that I’m missing work but added a screenshot of my grades.",
      "A professor is not legally/ethically permitted to discuss grades with anyone but the student (and other faculty/staff, as necessary), regardless of the student's age or standing. Parents will sometimes convince their student to sign a waiver or give login information allowing access to grades. However, a professor should not be having open conversations with parents; the university's relationship is to you - the student - and not to your parents, who are just your namesake and financial provider."

    "title:": "A letter to professors",
    "text": " Dear college professors, We are doing our best I know it may seem like we are slacking and not participating, but these last few months have been tough for all of us. Our school years were cut short, trips were cancelled, and we were forced inside all summer. As college students have all faced some sort of hardships during this time that need to be understood—and possibly given some compassion in how you deal with us. I am now a freshman in college, and it honestly does not feel like it. I sit at home all day, losing the motivation to do anything—especially school. I sit behind a camera and listen to... Lecture after Lecture after Lecture... It is getting Exhausting In high school, I was never one to procrastinate, but now it’s normal for me because home was always a place for relaxing, and limited learning. Online classes make me feel like I have all the time in the world to finish assignments, but then I get assigned even more homework in another class. At that point, I get stressed with all the work I have to do that could have been finished at an earlier time. There are many distractions surrounding us at home and it is hard to block them out. Whether it be our family talking, our pets making noise, or just our minds wandering. It is not easy to keep one’s mind focused on a screen for a whole class period, the mind does start to wander. There have been times where I am in a class and BOOM I completely blank and I start to think about other things and miss something important that the teacher was talking about. Yes, I had this problem in person-to-person classes too, but never as bad as I do now. Teachers are not there to get you back on track, so it is up to you to keep yourself engaged, which is hard when you are on a screen for most of your day and have little to no interaction with fellow classmates or teachers. To help us stay engaged small group discussions often can help. This gives us time to talk to our peers we usually don’t get to and hearing other people’s comments can really help to understand a subject. This little to no interaction with teachers and fellow classmates is difficult, but it is also hard because I was looking forward to making new friends during college, and now, it seems almost impossible. There’s no time for us to get to know each other, other than when we get put in a breakout room for no more than 20 minutes. Even then, I feel isolated. When you cannot make new friends due to not having the time to get to know each other, life becomes lonely. And loneliness has had a huge effect on my school year, forcing me to shut down at times because I do not know where to go for help when I need it, and I do not want to disturb my friends when they are going through the same things. Without the interaction I’m used to, I find it hard to wake up in the morning knowing that I will have to stare at a screen for how many hours of homework I happen to get that night. I feel like my whole life is school now and there is no time for me. I know I am not the only one feeling this way. My friends and I have talked about our experiences with online college and most of the opinions were not positive. Our lives have become the same routine everyday. Wake up, get online, do homework. Wake up, get online, do homework. Wake up, get online, do homework. With all of the screen time everyday that students have, you could give us breaks throughout the lecture and give us time to take a step back and breathe. Time away from the screen is important. For me, school is easier to get through when you have friends that are there to help you. Since the start of the fall semester, I have not talked to many of my friends that I used to talk to everyday. Physically being at school was so much easier because we knew that it was a place to focus and get work done. Now after a long school day, we just close our laptops and pray we make it through the semester. This is a new experience for all of us. Most students were going to school in person before the pandemic started and now everything is different. It is hard to go through change so fast and sudden. We never expected a pandemic to derail our lives, but it has. Take the time to think of the way we are feeling and understand that many of us would rather be in person, just like you would. Sincerely, A Stressed Student",

The issue is that it doesn’t feel like I’m paying for the education, just the degree. I’ve had to study pretty much on my own this entire year (like with Coursera, or additional textbooks). It just doesn’t feel like I’m learning anything in lectures. And also I’m studying pretty much 10 hours a day nonstop. I also can’t afford to keep retaking courses. So I thought maybe it’s a good idea to take a year off, learn most of the things I need to know for my degree at my own pace. And then return to uni, where I’ll be able to pass courses the first time and will get more free time. I know what subjects I need to know for my degree anyway and I basically teach myself everything already. I have a full day of almost 7 hours of lectures that are pretty useless, and if I didn’t have to go to them and study instead. I’ll have much more progress. Is this a good idea? Or am I buggin? I’m just not sure, because I haven’t heard of anybody doing this before. Like for most people it’s the other way around, like they go to uni to learn.

But if I keep the job I will have to be in an off campus apartment,get my own food/items, and depend on a bus transportation system to get from and to campus. I’ve been hesitant because I’m just trying to see what will end up working out for me the best. I think I’m just scared that I’m gonna miss out on an opportunity that the job will probably provide me. But I need to think about my financial position as well.

On my first day of class this past week I had my Microbiology professor say some things I consider to be really unprofessional.

He said he already cleared it with the Administration and as long as we were okay with it they would allow it. Then he goes into a spiel about how masks are pointless because they don't work; virus' are too small to be blocked by masks. When I questioned him on why would they mandate it if it didn't work he went into it about how Fauci is an idiot who was out of touch with reality and hasn't worked as a clinician since his residency many years ago. He also mentioned he got COVID-19 last January though I find that odd because I don't even think they were testing for COVID-19 at that point last year in the US. He then ends it with saying the only way to get over this mess that is COVID is herd immunity. Of course it's my fault for not speaking up right away, I just found it hard to when the whole class agreed immediately. I have a bit of social anxiety. But I do find all the things he said to be unprofessional. I know professors are human and can have opinions but I'm really put off by him asking if we would be ok with him taking his mask off. I'm looking for any advice on what to do in this situation or if anyone has been in a similar predicament. I'm weary of approaching I guess cause of my grades since he has control of them. Not sayin he would do anything but bias' are a real thing.",

The instructor turned in the grade after the deadline. Again, say what? Before finding out that a degree wasn’t granted, I contacted the uni asking why I haven’t received my diploma yet. They mentioned they were backordered and I wouldn’t receive until the end of summer. NEVER did anyone mention that I wouldn’t be awarded a degree. It’s likely my grad school won’t mind at all, and I’ll continue on like nothing happened, but my mind is blown right now. And I know the pandemic has really hit academia hard, but shit.

    "text": " I've always really excelled as a student. I graduated 9 in my class with a 4.4 GPA, and excelled in virtually every subject. I enjoy learning about pretty much everything. I went to a STEM-oriented magnet school my junior and sophomore year where I did well, and my dad, who is an engineer, told me that he would not let me go to college unless I went into a STEM field. Since my STEM grades were always good and I enjoyed pretty much everything that had to do with it, I agreed, and now I am at the University of Virginia as a prospective engineering student. There's always been one thing I enjoyed more than anything else, though: music. I play 6 instruments with several at a very advanced level, I have 16k followers for a social media account largely dedicated to my original music, I have several hundred monthly listeners on Spotify, and it's my absolute favorite thing in the world. I dedicate the majority of my free time to music and I couldn't imagine living without making it. When I think about music, I do not give a shit about engineering. Even though I've always been great at math, when it comes to imagining myself working an engineering job and dedicating my life to that, I wince. I'm good at it and I enjoy it, but I'm not passionate about it whatsoever. I've realized the only thing that's motivating me to continue doing my engineering homework is the idea of getting good grades, I rarely ever think about it outside of class. I feel like I'm being so pressured to go into something I really don't want to. I've always been told, \"If you're good at math, go into engineering.\" Well, here I am, and I don't feel at place here. I'm watching as students and teachers around me partake in engineering for fun, meanwhile, all of my extracurricular activities revolve around my artistic interests. I'm good at it, but I really don't care about it at all. I won't say I hate it, I just don't care. Sure, some of it's fun to learn about, but I have no drive whatsoever for it. My passions lie elsewhere, but thanks to my father forcing me into a STEM degree, I'm stuck with this. I don't want to be an engineer. I just don't care about it at all.",

    "text": " I'm in my final year of University, I was just about to write my papers but due to the whole Corona situation school has been closed indefinitely. As I was packing my things getting ready to leave tomorrow I started thinking of the time I've spent in school and one thing that stood out to me was the fact that I didn't make any effort to socialize and get to know people (especially girls). I didn't have fun or go to parties I just buried my head in my books for four years, before I consoled myself with the fact that these University years are temporary and it's worth sacrificing them for a brighter future. But then it occurred to me \"isn't everything in a way temporary\", there's no time or period in our lives that last forever, life itself doesn't last forever we're just left with memories and the older one gets the faster the years go by. Then I fantasize about becoming this rich famous person and as a result those who rejected me or treated me badly will regret their actions. Then I realized no one would really give a fuck, sure they will probably tell their friends they knew me but outside of that I will rarely come up in their mind and they will live their lives normally. To make things worse I will never be in this kind of environment again with such a high density of young beautiful women I can easily talk to because outside of University it will get harder to meet and talk to new people. It will take some painful and deliberate effort to meet someone and one would probably have to compromise on their standards too because it will feel like you're racing against the clock. It's not all bad though I'm on a 3.8 CGPA and I have some decent job offers waiting for me when I'm done with University. But I feel like no matter how successful I get in life it won't make up for the fact that I've missed out on so much in my University years. I also fear that going forward most relationships will be transactional as to what can I gain from this person. In personal relationships too in the sense that I'll probably be vetted whether I have a stable income before my personality comes into question. I'm not trying to make a point here, I'm not even sure of half of the things I've said, I'm just sad and confused. I have never really had any real life experience or had any sort of fun per say, I've always just been focused on school right from a young age living a sheltered life and I was hoping I could fix that in University but I'm almost done now. I'm scared of what's waiting for me out there. I honestly don't think I'm ready ..fuck I don't know. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks",

      "As I was packing too, I realized that I never socialized much outside of my classes.

(thats the only choice that i have, it's either i repeat the same year here or pursue graphic design). i also wanna mention that i'm not into technical stuff as much as i'm into creative stuff. i'm also from 3rd world country so with a software engineering degree can help me to go somewhere else and have a decent life outside of the country. i'm afraid that with a graphic design degree i wouldn't be able to. any advice would be helpful :)",

    "text": " Some of you asked so here it is .... the big update! First - if you end up in a situation as I did in my , this may be helpful info. Maybe not. So my professor ended up contracting COVID-19 and disappeared. With about 2 weeks left in our accelerated 6-week summer course, Prof slowly started coming back online. We ended up dropping a lot of labs and quizzes altogether from the syllabus and focused on the important shit. Also, prof made it clear he would be generous with grades since we were left to our own defenses to learn 6 chapters. We wrapped up on time and I got a solid A so I was happy to just wait for the prof to come back in the end. However, I did not learn what I would have had we had a normal class and so that is a little concerning. I am following up with the second part of this subject in the fall ( I took class A1 and now need to take class A2) so I may struggle but only time will tell. Prof did video lectures remainder of class - even being clearly sick he made a solid effort, and I really appreciate that. I thought he was strange for using a cell phone but turns out he was teaching from a hospital while in isolation - which is crazy and I have no idea how Prof did that but they did. So here is my advice to any student who ends up in a similar situation. First, start reading the textbook and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule unless it changes. Message your classmates (even if its 100% online and you don't know them personally), because odds are they have the same questions and will respond to you asap). If you get to the point where you haven't heard anything in over a week first email the Prof, then if no response then email your advisement consular who can help too. If all fails come back here and let us know because we have a LOT of awesome people in this sub that have really good advice. Life happens. Stay committed and on task. and this too shall pass. PS: fuck you COVID ... you are really screwing up my graduation timeline and everyone hates you",

      "I have now decided to major in Business Administration because the classes seem to be the most interesting to me, and it provides a well-rounded introduction to higher-level business roles as a more general study of business, not just the financial side. However, depending on the school some finance classes may be included into the major. I recommend looking at the class requirements for each and seeing which ones intrigue you the most, because though you may be looking at your goals in the far future, you still need to be intrigued and happy with what you are studying during your time in college.",

I hope this helped Congratulations on being accepted into college and best of luck and success in the future!",
      "If you’re not interested in economics, I wouldn’t major in it. Finance could be a good idea if you want to run your own business, as you’ll learn a lot about the financial aspects of entrepreneurship. Business administration could be good too for running a business since it covers so many business topics.",

      "Business Administration, Finance, or Economics? I have been accepted into college and am ready to begin my college career.",
      "I have now decided to major in Business Administration because the classes seem to be the most interesting to me, and it provides a well-rounded introduction to higher-level business roles as a more general study of business, not just the financial side. However, depending on the school some finance classes may be included into the major. I recommend looking at the class requirements for each and seeing which ones intrigue you the most, because though you may be looking at your goals in the far future, you still need to be intrigued and happy with what you are studying during your time in college.",

I hope this helped Congratulations on being accepted into college and best of luck and success in the future!",
      "I know I'll find more interesting. I would like to make a lot of money, and some day go off and do my own thing.",
      "If you’re not interested in economics, I wouldn’t major in it. Finance could be a good idea if you want to run your own business, as you’ll learn a lot about the financial aspects of entrepreneurship. Business administration could be good too for running a business since it covers so many business topics.",
      "Thank you for your help. Like my own business or maybe day trading, but more preferably my own business.",
      "One other suggestion I have is looking into accounting if that’s offered at your school. Having an accounting background can give you some good insight when it comes to running a business, and if you don’t want to immediately run your own business, accounting is a lucrative major.",
      "I’m not sure what degree I should pursue for my goals.",
      "If you can’t decide, I would go on job listings that you’re interested in and see what degree they have a preference for. Personally, I think finance would be the best choice because of all the career opportunities it would provide.",
      "I know that a finance degree, an economics degree, and even a business degree would be great for my goals.",

      "Econ is one of those things I wouldn’t suggest pursuing unless you’re passionate about it or at least think you could vibe well with it.",
      "Because I feel business, although not easy to run or manage, is something that you’re good at with experience instead of knowledge alone.",
      "I was in a similar position: I knew that I wanted to go into something related to business or finance but was not sure exactly what to major in.

This spring semester I took more general, core classes while I still had time to figure out what I wanted to do.",

So last semester, in the final weeks of the semester, I had a powerpoint presentation due in my nutrition class. We were all assigned a vitamin and had to make a presentation about this vitamin. This project was assigned to us on the first day of the semester and I knew this was going to be a quick, easy A, so like every student ever, I said \"meh, I'll do it later.\" WELL, later never came but you know what did come? The day of the presentations. So I stroll into this class, 9:30 am, iced coffee in hand, laid back, no concern over anything. The kid (S) next to me (B), leans over and goes S: How's your presentation look? B: Ha, what presentation? S: ... B: ... S: ... S: The presentation that's due today. Let me just say that my heart has never dropped so low, out my ass, and into the center of the Earth so fast in my life. B: ... oh shit. So, my last name starts with A... and the professor (P) goes: P: Alright, we're gonna start the presentations soon and I'm just gonna go in alphabetical order. Thank fuck that there were a few people before me that also had last names that started with A. So I I M M E D I A T E L Y open a fresh powerpoint, make a title card, and start Googling like I've never Googled in my life. I pulled up the project rubric in a small window on my laptop and I literally just started copying and pasting every question that was required to be in the presentation. I literally made a decent looking in 10 minutes and long story short, I got an A somehow. I somehow got an A on the most rushed piece of a shit thing I have ever produced in my academic career. It was so hard for me not to laugh while I was presenting and S was sitting there giggling his ass off cause he knew what I had done and that he had saved my ass. But yeah, don't procrastinate, set reminders, keep a planner, use a calendar, something.",

As it stands, I'm living in an 8x12 room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly 15 minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that. Honestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down. I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space. Right now, I need some advice on just getting through this semester, since I can't get a room change until after winter break.",

    "title:": "Some tips for online classes",
    "text": " I saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes. Tips: 1. First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into \"relax\" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it. 2. Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise. 3. PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes. 4. Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult. 5. Usually, you'd be in class about 2.5 hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you 2.5 hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a \"class time\" for yourself can really help. 6. Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with 4 or 5 slightly different versions of this. The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. Other considerations: 1. Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 2. Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that. 3. Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end. 4. Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end. I'm sure others can chime in with more suggestions or comments. Good luck with the transition.",

My anxiety has been through the roof and I spend most days just trying to make it through to the next one. I did start talking to a counselor last month and am trying to get my mental health back on track. My question is, is it a good idea to reach out to my profs and explain why I’ve been doing poorly? There’s a professor who I really respect, who even offered me a job in their lab over the summer, and I have several missing/ subpar assignments in their class. I don’t want them to think I’m lazy, or not taking their class seriously, and I’m worried that my performance the last few weeks has given them that impression.

As a professor I also have generalized anxiety disorder and adhd, so a lot of times I can identify with students who are having issues and offer support or point them in the right direction. With that being said, I also have a pretty good sniffer if a student is using mental health as an excuse to get out of doing work.",

The first head professor responded very quickly and told me that he couldn't do anything, the second head proffesor informed me that in this particular case she isn't the one in charge but the proffesor of our respective class is. So naturally I decided to talk to them instead, I write the same email and after a week without a response I decide talking to her directly. Here is where things escalated very quickly... Basically she was deeply offended by the suggestion, acted like I was saying her subject was less important than the other therefore she must be the one to take on the extra work of changing It, I tried explaining that It certainly wasn't the case the other one just had said no already, and that I just wanted to see if she was open to the possibility to discuss It with the class. She then got somehow more offended and acted like I was trying to undermine her by asking first the headprofessor (again, they are the ones to deal with this stuff in most cases, how could I have known that in this case an exception was made for the midterms??), and called me manipulative for trying to talk her into changing things around (again, I just asked No harm in asking...) especially without my peers present (I wanted the opportunity to discuss this matter in class with her permission!). I felt incredibly humiliated and apologised many, many times for 'disrespecting her', but she was having none of It, I even ended up crying a little because I don't handle well people yelling at me and I already had a lot going on (kinda like the last drop to overflow the glass) but she just said that 'I won't be led on by any manipulative behaviour or mannerisms of yours, in any case you should be crying for the utter lack of respect you have towards me' I feel awful, humiliated, and the worst part is that I can't avoid her classes by any means (mandatory subject, with group projects and I can't let down my teammates).

However, I couldn’t do that because I was a transfer student. I feel kinda bitter that my experience didn’t live up to my expectations and I’m terrified of what my life is gonna look like after this chapter of my life. I was supposed to be graduating this semester but my graduation got cancelled because of the virus. I’m trying to see the positives in the hardships I’ve experienced but I’ve really struggled. I’ve dealt with fake friends and I cut them off even though it was really hard and I didn’t meet decent people until I joined my sorority. I had a boyfriend for a year who was never really worth it and in retrospect I regret ever meeting him. And now that I’m graduating I feel like “my time is running out” and I feel myself getting older even though I’m 22. I always tell myself that I have higher expectations for the rest of my life because high school and college weren’t that amazing but I don’t wanna be disappointed again. I feel lonely because I feel like I’m the only one who feels this way. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

Moving on, I'm also going to be student teaching (English) next spring and she said to act like this is my student teaching before student teaching, so try to add things to the syllabus that I want to teach in my future classroom. So, I want to add a game called What Remains of Edith Finch to the syllabus. The video is only about an hour and a half long, but it's jam packed with story and is honestly the equivalent of a novel when you unpack everything. But I have friends telling me they'd never watch an hour and a half video, no matter how I split it up. I thought it would be a nice alternative to about an hour of reading homework for those days it's assigned, and would be a nice introduction to the rest of the course where we'd be going over \"modern\" analyzing (video essays, podcasts, and so on). What do you guys think?",

About an hour ago this morning, two male RA's rang the doorbell, and then let themselves into the apartment declaring a 'room inspection'. Within twenty seconds they came and knocked on my door, unlocked it with a key (without my consent), and opened to look into my room. I was still laying naked in my bed- I barely had time to fully get up and throw clothes on. They did this with all of our rooms, including a roommate who left campus already (so I know she was not there to give consent). I feel very uncomfortable with what just happened. For room inspections, normally if they knock and nobody answers/opens the door, they take note of that and return another time. But I did not give them permission to come in! They also seemed to be joking/laughing with each other during the process which seemed very unprofessional. I feel like this is a violation of privacy. I'm very upset and not sure what to do. I sent an email to housing services but as it's Saturday, I won't hear from anyone until the weekday. Any advice? Is this normal?",

I'm very excited though, because I have received around $12,000 in scholarships and Grant's, and with all the work I'm putting in at 2 full time jobs I'm able to use the money I saved up to pay the whole year out of pocket and avoid loans I'm extremely satisfied with all the work and dedication I put in in order to make this a reality",

    "text": " I graduated high school in 2018, went to community college for 2 years and am now almost ending my second semester at my university. My high school experience wasn’t the best because I felt terribly lonely all the time. I hardly had any friends, never went to parties or just out with anyone, didn’t have a boyfriend(still haven’t had one) and being introverted didn’t help the situation either. I missed out on a ton of things and memories because of my self esteem issues and introvertedness. I graduated with one friend I thought would be my life friend but that didn’t work out and I now keep in contact with no one from high school. Community college was pretty much the same situation. The first 2 semesters were great though. I met a lot of cool people but those friendships never lasted. The last 2 semesters I felt just as lonely as I did in high school. Fast forward to now, after me transferring to my university and doing all online classes for the past 2 semesters, I still feel like the same person I was in high school. I will say that I’ve changed a lot mentally and physically however. I gained a lot more confidence, came out of my shell a little, and my mindset isn’t the same. But after scrolling through Instagram and stalking the pages of my former classmates, seeing them doing great things, having fun with friends, getting married, having kids etc. I can’t help but feel like I haven’t changed at all these past 3 years. I haven’t made any amazing memories or experienced anything spectacular and I can’t help but feel sad because of it. I have only one person I can call my friend. I’m 21 and I feel like I should’ve done more. I guess I’m saying all of this to say, does anyone feel the same or went through something similar that can share their piece of advice? It sucks feeling like your youth is being wasted away.",

The class average was a 70. I studied so hard for a 50. Everyone in the groupchat who asks questions about homework and actually puts in effort, has grades in the 30-40 range. Fuck this. Update for clarification: So essentially, the first midterm was adjusted because some of the questions were wrong, so everyone got 30 extra points. I didn't think that the class average was after the adjustment (even though it's pretty obvious now that I think of it) so the class average was a 70 and I got an 80. The curve is added after the class so I have a lot of reasons to be optimistic. All the answers for the first test were on the internet and chegg. Essentially working through the problem with just 1 number changed. So a lot of people probably cheated. You do not have to show any work and grades are just based off the answers. The first test was just 5 really long questions. It's not a great format imo. I have another midtern soon and hopefully all the answers won't be on chegg like last time. I'm just gonna take it without chegg and hope for the best.",

      "As a quiet kid, when there is someone like yourself who willingly answers every single question I just don’t bother raising my hand. I’ve found this is usually the same, people figure that they won’t have to raise there hand since you’re there to answer everything. I would suggest that you ease out of answering every question.",
      "That'll make the class worse. It ends up seeming really unbalanced because I’m the only one talking, but I’d like it if others had something to say, too.",
      "If they aren’t bothering to raise they’re hand then why shouldn’t YOU? You’re here not only to increase your education, but to make connections. One of the best ways to get noticed by your professor in a large class is to periodically show that your engaged (I.e. raising your hand to answer questions).",

I talked to my advisor and he said there’s nothing he can do and told me to “change my major” after 5 years of hard work and passion to get the degree I want😭.",

By changing the year, I no longer needed that one class that was full and unavailable and I was able to take a different class that still fulfilled that requirement of my degree. I hope your university/advisors can do something similar.",

I'm 25 and most of my friends are well out of their bachelor's and some are in masters programs. Meanwhile I'm just about to finish my associates degree and I feel weird for wanting to celebrate. This will be my 3rd attempt at college. I failed all of my classes and dropped out of college at 19 and I only went back at 23. There was a long period of time where I thought I would never have any form of college degree and I never thought I would get this opportunity again. I got pictures taken in my cap and gown on Friday and seeing the pictures was surreal and just a feeling of such pride but I'm embarrassed to admit how proud I am. I even got to wear my honors chord which felt unreal since I have a history of failing classes. It doesn't even seem real to me that I would be an honors student. I send a picture of me in the cap and gown to my dad and he was so proud but he was mad at me that I didn't tell him I'm graduating. I guess I didn't mention it because it didn't even register that I'm actually getting a degree in may. Like I didn't think it mattered enough to mention to my parents which I know makes no sense. Since I'm transferring I have been so focused on my end goal of a bachelor's degree but I saw those pictures today and it just hit me I'm going to have a college degree! I want to be proud of myself and celebrate but for some reason it feels silly to me since I'm so much farther behind than everyone I know. Even my little cousin has already graduated with a bachelors degree. I know I should be proud but for some reason it's embarrassing and part of me wants to wait til I get my bachelor's to celebrate.",

      "So testing anxiety comes from two things one you haven’t studied, you don’t know the material and you don’t know how to understand the material. The other is the material hasn’t been presented in a way that you can digest it because it’s out of congruence with your learning style. How many times a week do you show up for your professors office hours and ask preplanned questions about parts of the curriculum that you don’t understand?",
      "This is a valid form of anxiety and they will help you with it. I can’t say what might happen for you, but at my uni after speaking with someone, one of the accommodations they gave me was 1. of the original testing time, and I could take tests in their specific quiet room away from the classroom.",
      "Would also suggest that ypu talk to the counseling services office on your campus if they have one. Often these offices are free to students and can really help with dealing with the various forms of anxiety and stress that students often experience. Also as a prof I would say that your profs will back you on getting the accommodations and will gladly work with you on it.",

After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and 5 minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. I just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with.

Procrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite feeling like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental.

    "title:": "A Former Student’s Top Tips for College",
    "text": " As a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. I would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. I didn’t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!",

Basically, I have no choice but to take that class next fall semester and then I finally get to graduate in December. The debate is this: option one - I can either knock out 16/19 credits over a 6 week session in the summer. It’s 5 classes (one being business calc, kill me) and all but the calc are online. I would live in an apartment on campus and then be able to live at home for the fall semester for the one class Option 2 - take 4 of the classes that are online from home and not live on campus so I can save on housing money, but then I’d have to do business calc in the fall in addition to the other class. I might be able to live at home for this as well but it depends on whether or not the school approves me to do so Option 3: take only a couple summer courses, then take 4 in the fall to make it a full semester and live on campus The biggest factor in my decision is the business calc. I failed twice already and if I fail again I can’t graduate with this degree. I’m nervous to take it in the summer bc it’s six weeks of 2hour long classes four days a week. The only redeeming factor about this is that all my other classes are online so that’s the only in person class, all the others are gonna be mostly reading stuff and writing essays/doing online quizzes and stuff which I don’t anticipate to be terribly hard but there’s no guarantee of that. I’m so lost on what to do here I just wanna graduate as easily as possible without any more bumps in the road so I’d love various opinions and advice",

I would live in an apartment on campus and then be able to live at home for the fall semester for the one class Option 2 - take 4 of the classes that are online from home and not live on campus. so I can save on housing money, but then I’d have to do business calc in the fall in addition to the other class.. I might be able to live at home for this as well but it depends on whether or not the school approves me to do so Option 3: take only a couple summer courses, then take 4 in the fall to make it a full semester and live on campus The biggest factor in my decision is the business calc.",

In my first year I began my journey in computer science thinking I had to maintain a 60% in my courses to graduate. However, my school requires it's students to apply at the end of the first year to be admitted in the actual Cs major. Meaning there are internal requirements I must meet in order to get into CS. Some include a minimum gpa of 3.3/4.0 and mid 80s in my first year courses. I didn't get in my first year, so I tried again in second year and again failed to get a high mark good enough for a CS major. In my third year right now battling tremendous depression and anxiety because cs has always been my dream major. My parents think I am in cs and have good grades which I don't. I have been lying to them and forging my transcript everytime they see my marks and I am honestly exhausted. I have lost my appetite, lost roughly 8kgs and now have insomnia problems, diarrhea and other health issues.

On the other hand I am worried that it would be very stressful to move to another continent without any help. Thank you",

    "text": " Sounds really dumb to say but it’s literally whats happening. I am currently dealing with “Social Bullying” that has gotten so bad I’ve lost 2 of my best friends (both relationships over 4+ yrs) because of it. The group in question I was friends with until one of the friends started treating me and my family like dirt, going as far as calling my disabled mother the “crazy lady” for buying them all food. I told the group I was uncomfortable and left the friend group, but still wanted to stay friends with the majority of the group…which didn’t happen. I’ve caught them spreading rumors/talking shit about me 8 separate times. I’ve had to be moved into a separate single dorm, change my classes, etc just to try to have peace. Now my friends all hate me because of these rumors, despite me proving them false time and time again. These ex-friends are unfortunately the “popular kid” group and are friends with everyone on campus, so anytime I try to make friends its always either a look of disgust or they act overly friendly then report anything “off” to the group. (I say “off” bc they villainize everything I say at this point) I am completely alone and I can’t even go to class without being in fear. My school thinks the only form of harassment is sexual so there’s nothing I can report, either. I only have support from friends online/my mom. Luckily this year is almost over, but does anyone have advice for the upcoming year?",

    "text": " When I originally enrolled in college, I was a biology major. My first semester of freshman year, I took a medical science class and realized that I loved it, and wanted to pursue nursing. Later in the semester I decided to transfer schools (long story), and when I got to the new school, I changed to a nursing major. When I got to this new school, I wasn’t allowed to pick my classes, and I was assigned a nursing advisor who chose all of my classes for me. This nursing advisor totally screwed my schedule up, and now I have to take ten credits over the summer to catch myself back up in order to apply for nursing school on time. There is also a possibility that I will have to retake a chemistry course, so I could possibly be 13 credits behind. I entertained the idea of changing my major again to Biology with a medical focus because I absolutely love medical science and the human body, but my parents shut me down and were very angry. They had a problem with me changing to nursing in the first place, and an even bigger problem with me changing back to bio. This process made me realize that my heart lies with biology, and while I do love nursing, biology is what I’m good at and what I enjoy the most. It also is a lot for me to have to take an entire semester over the summer while still working. The chances of me getting into the nursing school are fairly low right now as it is because I have to take several prerequisites at a community college, and my chemistry grade is lacking. I’m just terrified to tell my parents I want to change. Any advice?",

The other internship is paid, up to 40/hrs a week, doing political work such as lobbying with local leaders and organizing action groups, it sounds interesting, but definitely not what I want to do in the long run. The law firm has told me that they will be as flexible as possible and work around my summer schedule. Is it possible to take on both?

      "I know that hiring managers, in my experience, don't usually differentiate my two majors as something that will result in two different degrees, even though they technically will. They also aren't curious about how many credits I've earned exactly.",
      "Here is why I am considering taking a year so early -an extra year to work on the lsat -financial aid is kinder rather than being broke and trying to do summer and winter classes -no burn out from constant schoolwork -120 credits gets me 1 degree with 2 majors listed on it, 150 credits gets me 2 separate degrees with a major on each one.",
      "To be fair, that's for understandable reasons, too; whether two degrees across two majors or just one degree across two majors, credits for two areas of study were fulfilled as an undergraduate student. More than anything else, the two areas of study (or majors) themselves are what will determine what interests hiring managers. Generally speaking, I've found the same for professionals in academia with the additional idea that majors are often incidentally part of different degree programs, with those different degrees not amounting to differences worth mentioning."

I don't know for sure what will happen in terms if I am going to be able to pay for the rest of the two years when I transfer or if, by luck, I will get enough aid to manage it. If I move forward with the loan, I'm scared it'll become too hard to maintain because my parents can't help me financially so I'm on my own. It feels like I'm just betting on luck either way and don't know what to do.",

But recently I’ve been hearing that it’s really hard to make friends and meet people in college. I also deal with social anxiety so I’m worried about that making it even harder. I plan to join clubs and attend events and stuff to try my best to put myself out there, and all I really want is to finally find my people, but I’m worried I’m getting my hopes up. Any advice?",

My professor, an African-American male (I am a white male) took time the next class to give every group feedback one at a time, and when he spoke with my group he went over the slide I presented. I said on it “some people in poverty are lazy or have a lack of good work habits and work opportunities”. During the feedback he read this and got angry, then immediately said “thats racist, your a racist for saying that and that has been a black stereotype for generations, in fact your group leader is racist for allowing that to happen”. Infront of my group he labeled me as a racist when I mention nothing about race, color or ethnicity of which I immediately became angry and upset but I had no response since we were all just stunned and shocked he just called us that. He assumed I was talking about black people when I never did which is purely racist of him to do so especially as a professor. We move on to another slide I created and presented where I talk about welfare, snap and Medicaid for people in poverty. On this slide I said “The majority of undereducated and poor people first need food, medical benefits and shelter” he then swiftly says that’s another stereotype and you are wrong for saying that since you don’t know these people and never talked to these people. I again was very upset because my family is on welfare, snap and Medicaid and for him to say I know nothing about this was infuriating and filled me with emotion. I tried to defend myself and he said stop talking, someone else speak. I believe he has a bias and prejudice against me and I am now uncomfortable with him a day person let alone as a professor in an education teaching environment. I am asking y’all what should I do or go about this? I am not a racist and never have been called one and for this to happen especially from a professor which I am supposed to be learning from is beyond me. What should I do?",

If you fully researched all of the aspects as to why unemployment rates were so high compared to employment rates you would been able to give a more in-depth answer.",
      "We move on to another slide I created and presented where I talk about welfare, snap and Medicaid for people in poverty.",
      "Your comment about some poor people being lazy was unnecessary, and what most people seem to think of anyone who is unemployed or underemployed. PoC stereotypically make up that portion, though a lot of white people also require assistance. Your Professor is wrong in my opinion for getting all uppity about the poor and undereducated requiring help for basic human rights such as food, shelter, and Medicaid.",
      "Thankyou I appreciate you. On this slide I said “The majority of undereducated and poor people first need food, medical benefits and shelter” he then swiftly says that’s another stereotype and you are wrong for saying that since you don’t know these people and never talked to these people.",
      "He could have said you were a jerk and that might’ve been fine…But idk how he got racist out of what you said. Classist maybe, but racist? I dont think so.",
      "I again was very upset because my family is on welfare, snap and Medicaid and for him to say I know nothing about this was infuriating and filled me with emotion.",
      "Also on the welfare thing, you generalized a whole group of people based on your sole experience. I think he may have bias simply because of your first comment. Maybe you’re not racist but you’re ignorant, which lead you to make ignorant and racist statements."

I was told recently during office hours for a CS class that the file and code I wrote was not needed and that I was doing it wrong and all I had to do was this and that and whatever and she ended by saying \"It's easy.\" That made me feel like shit cause I didn't know how to do it despite it being \"easy\" and I was in a depressing mood for the rest of the day and the following day as well. Saying that an assignment is easy is just unnecessary. You have no idea what someone's struggles are, with the content/class and outside of that as well. While an assignment could technically be easy, that doesn't mean it's easy for someone to get up and sit down to do the assignment if they're struggling with their mental health, family issues etc.",

    "text": " So my first semester I didn’t try very hard and didn’t study thinking that I could pull the same stuff I did in high school and ended straight up failing half my classes and getting a 1.26 GPA. Over winter break I thought to myself you can do better than that and in the spring semester I applied myself to my studies a lot more diligently, started going to office hours and supplemental instruction classes even if I didn’t think I needed to, and got help from my fraternity brothers who had taken my classes before and ended up getting a 3.57 GPA this semester and got on the Dean’s List. Moral of the story: never give up and you can always do better; even if you failed a couple classes :)",
